## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Added `wake_the_claude.bash` operational guidance to `notes/DEVELOPER_CHEATSHEET.md`, including `--resume` usage, session file safety constraints, and troubleshooting commands.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Shell script to launch Claude Code sessions with configurable flags, session persistence, and resume support
- `notes/SESSION_ID_VALIDATION_BUGFIX_PLAN.md` — Root cause analysis and fix plan
- `notes/SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` — Security vulnerability analysis and remediation plan
- `notes/pull_requests/PR_SESSION_ID_VALIDATION_BUGFIX.md` — PR description archive
- `notes/templates/TEMPLATE_PULL_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION.md` — PR description template (adopted from sibling repos)

### Fixed

- **Session ID validation**: Redirected diagnostic `echo` statements to stderr (`>&2`) in `is_valid_uuid`, `retrieve_session_id`, and `validate_session_id`, reserving stdout exclusively for return values captured via `$(...)`
- **Subshell exit status**: Moved `RETURN_VALUE=$?` to a separate line after command substitution so the exit status propagates to the parent scope
- **Double usage print**: Replaced `usage`/`exit` calls with `return` inside `validate_session_id`, since `exit` inside `$(...)` only terminates the subshell
- **Ambiguous log message**: Added `session_id_filename` local variable to preserve the original filename for the "from file" log message

### Security

- **Path traversal in `--resume`** (High): Reject filenames containing path separators (`/`) or lacking `.txt` extension; removed destructive `rm -f` from `retrieve_session_id`; suppressed raw file content in error logs
- **Arbitrary file write in `save_session_id`** (High): Added UUID format validation before any filesystem write; applied `basename` defense-in-depth; scoped `session_id` as `local`
- **Argument injection via `CLAUDE_CODE_PARAMS`** (Medium): Converted from flat string to bash array; execute with `"${CLAUDE_CODE_PARAMS[@]}"` to prevent word-splitting injection
