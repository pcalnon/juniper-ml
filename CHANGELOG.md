## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Perf lane — nothing "stops" the first-pass burst; the training thread is re-pinned during
  candidate result collection, and `torch.get_num_threads()` is not a passive read**
  (`notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-BURST-TERMINATOR-AND-ICV-INSTRUMENT.md`).
  Both residuals left open by §7 of
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-BURST-LIBRARY-ATTRIBUTION.md` are
  closed, and **that note's named suspect is refuted**. libgomp's per-thread `nthreads-var` ICV is
  readable through `ctypes` (`omp_get_max_threads()` returns the *calling thread's* width), which
  is the quantity the whole arc had been inferring. Results: (1) §5's one **inferred** link — that
  `omp_set_num_threads` binds the calling thread — is now **measured** (constructor thread 2,
  training thread created afterwards **16**; importing torch pins the importing thread to 8, so
  the 16 is libgomp's default, not torch's). (2) The question "what ends the burst" had a false
  premise: **nothing does** — the burst ends when the initial output pass ends, ICV still 16. The
  growth loop instead **re-pins the thread 16 → 2**, which is why *later* passes are quiet. Scored
  separately and oppositely in both runs: "the drop ends the burst" **REFUTED** (the burst was over
  2.90 s / 3.49 s earlier), "the drop is why later passes do not burst" **SUPPORTED** (peak 2
  threads after). (3) **Candidate-pool creation is excluded** — `_ensure_worker_pool` returns with
  the ICV still 16; the re-pin is localised to the `result_queue.get()` that unpickles the first
  worker's `CandidateTrainingResult`, inside `_collect_training_results`. (4) §5.1 is **inverted**:
  the sustained matmul is not immune to its thread, it **re-pins its own thread** and then runs at
  that width, while `loss.backward()` (9.59 cores) and cascor's real output pass (10.14) do not
  re-pin and burst — so the burst is the *absence* of a re-pin, not a special wide path. (5) New
  hazard: **`torch.get_num_threads()` re-pins the calling thread** (16 → 16 without the call, 16 →
  8 with it), so the occupancy note's §4.2 proposed discriminator would have destroyed the
  measurement it was meant to take; that section now carries the warning. Consequence for the open
  cascor thread-pin decision: the defect's **extent** is bounded to the initial output pass only,
  not a whole-run 16-wide regime. No owner decision is taken or re-opened. New under `util/ad-hoc/`:
  `2026-09-11_omp_icv_checkpoint_probe.py` (the instrument) and `2026-09-11_icv_trace_align.py`
  (the reducer, which scores the two claims separately); new
  `tests/test_pf8_icv_checkpoint_probe.py` (18 tests) wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `AGENTS.md` (test count 164 → 165) and `docs/REFERENCE.md`. Corrections applied at source to
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-BURST-LIBRARY-ATTRIBUTION.md` (§5,
  §5.1, §5.3, §7, status line) and
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-OCCUPANCY-PROBE.md` (§4.2).
- **Perf lane — the initial output pass's ~11-core burst is libgomp under torch, not NumPy's
  OpenBLAS, and cascor's parent thread pin binds only the thread that ran the constructor**
  (`notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-BURST-LIBRARY-ATTRIBUTION.md`). The
  discriminating test left open by §4.2 of
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-OCCUPANCY-PROBE.md` was run, and it
  **refutes that section's leading candidate**. Pinning `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=2` alone leaves the
  burst intact (16 threads, 13.7 cores) while the OpenBLAS pool demonstrably shrinks (alive threads
  43 → 29); pinning `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` alone removes it entirely (2 threads, 2.0 cores); and
  `libopenblas` appears in **0.0%** of 614 native-profile samples against `libgomp`'s 47.6% and
  `torch::autograd::Engine`'s 44.0%. All three listener arms ran the identical complete 4000-epoch
  pass, so this is not a vacuous comparison. Root cause: cascor pins the parent with
  `torch.set_num_threads(2)` in the network **constructor**
  (`juniper-cascor/src/cascade_correlation/cascade_correlation.py:617` → `:1179-1180`), while the
  service constructs in `_create_network_locked` (`api/lifecycle/manager.py:1538`) on the request
  thread and trains in `_run_training` (`:2476`) on the `cascor-train` executor (`:2431`) — so the
  thread doing the work keeps OpenMP's default width of 16. In one process, unchanged otherwise,
  moving the pass off the constructor's thread takes it from 1.53 cores / 2 threads to 9.45 / 16,
  and constructing on that same worker thread restores 1.48 / 2. `torch.get_num_threads()` reads 2
  throughout — it reports the library global, not the width in force on the working thread.
  Consequence: exporting `JUNIPER_CASCOR_BLAS_THREADS` from `runtime.blas_threads` would **mask**
  this defect rather than repair it, so "implement the `runtime:` block" is not the whole fix; the
  narrower repair is a cascor change and remains an owner decision. Two residuals are named rather
  than papered over: what ends the burst after the initial pass (measured in both the listener and
  one process — 16 `_retrain_output_layer` calls produce exactly one ≥10-thread block — and *not*
  explained by the mechanism above, which predicted the opposite), and the exact PyTorch path that
  re-widens off the constructor thread while a plain matmul does not. New under `util/ad-hoc/`:
  `2026-09-10_first_pass_library_attribution.py`, `2026-09-10_listener_thread_census.py`,
  `2026-09-10_listener_burst_probe.bash`, `2026-09-10_pyspy_stack_attribute.py`; new
  `tests/test_pf8_burst_attribution.py` (14 tests) wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the
  `AGENTS.md` test list and `docs/REFERENCE.md`. Also corrects a reading carried by the occupancy
  note through six consensus rounds: its "four hundred `train_output_layer … Epoch N` lines" are
  400 INFO lines at `epoch_display_frequency` = 10, i.e. **4000 epochs**, matching the cell's
  `output_epochs: 4000` — the pass has no early exit.
- **Perf lane — PF-8 located and its pair run; the experiment YAML's `runtime:` block binds nothing**
  (`notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-10_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-OCCUPANCY-PROBE.md`). Step 1 of §1.3
  of `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-08_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-RESCOPE-AND-MICRO-TIMING-REFERENCE.md`
  ran: one PF-1-shape run consumes **4.52 cores** under cascor's default thread budget (3 cells,
  1.1% spread) as one ~11-core block in the listener for the *initial* output pass (160 of 1770
  steps, before the candidate pool exists) then ~1.8 for the rest, and **2.15** under the
  four-variable budget `run_suite` pins for a parallel arm — 34% faster per step overall, 8× on
  that initial pass and +9.3 to +10.4% on the other 91% of steps, at an identical `step_count` 1770. Step 2
  ran because 4.52 is inside the ~4–8 band: three aligned parallel pairs against six sequential
  controls, same budget, all twelve cells at 1770 — **a second concurrent pinned run costs +11.3%
  per step, +8.5 to +12.7% leaving one pair out**, inside the sweep's 20.5% quiet band and outside the
  day's within-arm spread; advisory, as item 4.3 said. The burst is removed by the three BLAS
  variables, which `torch.set_num_threads` does not reach and which the YAML's
  `runtime.blas_threads` never sets: the block is validated by the driver, accepted by the service,
  and read by nothing on either path — an owner decision (implement or retire), not a fix — and
  **PF-3's `runtime.num_processes` matrix axis is therefore inert** (P2 item 2.2 blocked). Which
  library carries the burst is narrowed (NumPy's OpenBLAS pool the leading candidate), not
  identified. *(Superseded the same day by the entry above: it is libgomp under `libtorch_cpu`,
  and OpenBLAS carries none of it.)* Micro timing reference `0003` re-cut at 1-minute load 5.3 → 7.1 (the prior cuts were
  at 9–10); the micro tier does not see that difference (median ratio 0.99). New under
  `util/ad-hoc/`: `2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_sampler.py` (per-role `/proc` deltas at 1 s),
  `2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_analyse.py` (drive-window reduction, sweep-curve readout, two-arm
  comparison with identity checks), `2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_probe_suite.yaml`,
  `2026-09-10_pf8_two_run_parallel_suite.yaml`, `2026-09-10_pf8_pair_driver.bash`,
  `2026-09-10_micro_reference_compare.py`, `2026-09-10_torch_thread_pin_probe.py`;
  `tests/test_pf8_occupancy_probe.py` (26 tests, wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Changed:
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-02_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-P2-PLAN.md` (rows 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, the §3
  graph and a §4 hazard), `notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-08_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-RESCOPE-AND-MICRO-TIMING-REFERENCE.md`
  (a dated blockquote in §1.3), `docs/REFERENCE.md` (PF-8 row, test reference),
  `util/experiments/suites/perf/README.md` (PF-3 and PF-8 rows), `util/experiments/suites/perf/pf3-cascor-pool-scaling.yaml`
  (header only: the `runtime.num_processes` axis is inert; do not launch as written), `AGENTS.md`
  (test list, Last Updated).

- **Perf lane — Wave 4 re-scoped, the micro timing reference established, PF-2 probed**
  (`notes/JUNIPER_2026-09-08_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PERF-LANE-PF8-RESCOPE-AND-MICRO-TIMING-REFERENCE.md`).
  Item 4.3 answered before any harness was built: PF-8 has no gate content (`step_count` was
  invariant across a 3× load span in every sweep cell) and the concurrent-launch harness Wave 4
  planned to build already exists — `run_suite` parallel mode accepts a two-cell cascor suite
  (the 2026-08-30 version floor lifted the one-checkout refusal; dry-run verified), allocating
  disjoint ports and pinning equal thread budgets. 4.1 withdrawn, 4.2 re-specified as a suite
  pair and **blocked on a CI hazard**: `tests/test_experiment_suite_yamls.py` loads every suite in
  CI, where no cascor sibling exists and the floor check fails closed. Item 2.4 shipped as
  `juniper-cascor#638` (a report-only pytest-benchmark reference, host identity compared, load
  condition recorded; a census of all 22 `baseline_*.json` files that ever existed — 312
  entries — found zero timing keys, `util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_cascor_baseline_history_census.py`).
  Item 2.1's calibration probe ran (`util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_pf2_epoch_calibration_suite.yaml`,
  with `util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_loadavg_sampler.py` recording the host condition the driver does
  not). Three inherited phrases corrected at source: "no timing tolerance of any kind" (P1 design
  §1 — two fixed absolute ceilings exist; none is baseline-relative), "10× dataset range" (P2 item
  2.1 — it is 8×), and the Wave 4 "no harness exists" premise. `docs/REFERENCE.md` and
  `util/experiments/suites/perf/README.md` PF-4 / PF-8 rows updated.

- `tests/test_duplicati_scheduled_backup.py` — hermetic gate for the #1292 systemd
  `--user` scheduled-backup lane (`util/duplicati_scheduled_backup.bash`,
  `util/duplicati_backup_failure.bash`, `util/install_duplicati_timer.bash`, and the
  three unit files). Pins the fail-closed class the 2026-07-13 silent-stop incident
  encoded: empty/short passphrase, unmounted or wrong-filesystem destination, tmpfs
  volume staging, skip-or-fail stale escalation, OnFailure reporter (durable log
  first; `notify-send` cannot change the exit), installer copies-not-symlinks and
  never `enable --now`. Wired into `ci.yml` / `main-verify.yml`.

- **`util/open_signed_pr.py`** — promoted from `util/ad-hoc/` to a permanent utility after it landed
  the #1099 signing fan-out across 8 repos. Opens a PR on any Juniper repo whose commit is
  **GitHub-signed**, by creating branch + commit + PR through the API (`createCommitOnBranch`) rather
  than a local checkout. That matters because `required_signatures` rejects unsigned commits
  fleet-wide, GPG/YubiKey signing is unavailable to a runner, and an unsigned commit *anywhere* in a
  branch's history blocks the merge; GitHub signs API-authored commits. It also needs no working
  tree, making it the path of choice when a session is confined to one worktree and cannot commit in
  sibling checkouts.
  - Gains `--delete` (repeatable) alongside `--add`, so the two together express a file move in one
    signed commit; at least one is now required. `fileChanges.deletions` is omitted entirely when
    unused rather than sent as an empty list.
  - Safety contract unchanged and now pinned by tests: refuses on an existing open PR for the branch
    and on an existing branch (never force-updates another ref), pins `expectedHeadOid` to the
    resolved base sha so a concurrent push fails loudly instead of clobbering, and `--dry-run`
    resolves read-only and writes nothing.
- `tests/test_open_signed_pr.py` — hermetic suite for the above (`gh` is a PATH stub recording argv
  and replaying canned stdout; no network, repo, or `git`). `util/` sits outside every pre-commit
  Python hook's scope, so this is the gate. Wired into `ci.yml`.

### Added

- **`util/ad-hoc/2026-08-24_bot_pr_census.py`**, **`_bot_pr_merge_sweep.py`**, **`_bot_pr_converge.py`** —
  the three-stage tooling used for the 2026-08-24 fleet dependabot sweep (24 bot PRs merged across
  all 9 repos, zero left open). Census enumerates, sweep arms GitHub-native auto-merge, converge
  drives the survivors. Each carries a guard earned by a defect found during that sweep:
  - **Census retries `gh`.** juniper-cascor-client returned a graphql i/o timeout and would have
    been recorded as *zero* bot PRs; it had two. A network failure is not an answer — the
    silently-skipped-repo class of ml#1305.
  - **Sweep gates on REQUIRED contexts, not the rollup.** ml#1304 showed five checks, all
    `Cursor Automation … skipping`, and read as clean while **0 of its 17 required contexts had
    ever run** — it is authored by `app/github-actions`, and GitHub does not let `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    PRs trigger workflows. A vacuous green on a *write* path is how untested code merges.
  - **Sweep refuses any repo whose `allow_auto_merge` is false**, where `--auto` silently degrades
    to an immediate merge that, under the owner's ruleset bypass, can land unfinished checks.
  - **Converge exists only because `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true` is paired with
    `allow_update_branch: false`** on all 9 repos. GitHub's auto-merge cannot clear `BEHIND`, and
    every sibling merge causes it, so 10 of 17 armed PRs stalled indefinitely. Converge issues the
    `update-branch` GitHub will not, then lets the already-armed auto-merge fire. **Setting
    `allow_update_branch: true` retires this script**; its header says so.
- `util/ad-hoc/retired/2026-08-24_{await_pr_merge,await_main_verify,bot_pr_sweep_watch,ml_pr_converge}_RETIRED-2026-08-25.*` —
  four one-off drivers from the same day, retired per the #928 precedent rather than deleted; their
  headers now record what each produced, including the `Allow-Symbol-Loss` waiver surviving ml#1316's
  squash and the armed-but-`BEHIND` split that exposed the config deadlock above.

### Changed

- **All eight decision-11 floors raised — the meta-package now resolves the released contract, not the
  retired one.** `[clients]` `juniper-data-client>=0.5.0` and `juniper-cascor-client>=0.8.0`; `[servers]`
  `juniper-canopy>=0.7.0`, `juniper-cascor>=0.11.0`, `juniper-data>=0.14.0`; `[recurrence]`
  `juniper-recurrence-model>=0.3.0,<0.4.0`, `juniper-recurrence>=0.5.0,<0.6.0`,
  `juniper-recurrence-client>=0.3.0,<0.4.0`. Decision 11 (§9.5 of
  `notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-29_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_TRAIN-EVAL-TEST-PARTITION-DESIGN.md`, producer-side
  juniper-data#369) retired the `*_full` family, and every package above shipped its half of that
  change. Until now `pip install juniper-ml[recurrence]` could not resolve the new versions **at all**:
  the old caps were `juniper-recurrence-model<0.3.0` and `juniper-recurrence-client<0.3.0`, which
  actively forbid the releases that carry `derive_full_split` — the reconstruction `POST /v1/crossval`
  depends on for a post-#369 artifact.

  These are **floors on a meta-package**, so nothing here is a behaviour change in this repo; the
  behaviour is in the pinned packages, each documented in its own changelog. The lockstep artifacts
  move with them: `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` (which asserts the exact strings), the four extras
  tables in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md` and `docs/REFERENCE.md`, and a new `0.8.x`
  row in the compatibility matrix — whose prose still said "juniper-ml 0.6.0 declares" while the
  package was at 0.7.1.

- **`juniper-cascor-client` floored at `>=0.8.0`, which is where the base-URL host guard actually
  starts.** `docs/REFERENCE.md`'s HTTP-client note said the latest released data-client was `0.4.2` and
  "still lacks the host guard", so `pip install juniper-ml[clients]` could resolve a wheel that
  "silently accepts `HTTPS://host` (TLS downgrade)". Checked against the *published* wheels in a clean
  venv: `juniper-data-client` 0.5.0 and `juniper-cascor-client` 0.8.0 both refuse a hostless `https://`
  and both **normalise** `HTTPS://host` to `https://host`, so the TLS-downgrade reading is withdrawn.
  What survived was narrower and was a live gap — the data-client floor guaranteed the guard, the
  cascor-client floor did not. Each published cascor-client wheel was then probed in a throwaway venv
  (`util/ad-hoc/2026-09-11_cascor_client_guard_boundary.py`): **0.5.0, 0.6.0 and 0.7.0 all fail both
  halves**, and **0.8.0 is the first release carrying either**. The floor is set from that measurement
  rather than from the changelog that introduced the fix, and the gap is closed rather than documented.

- Widened the `recurrence` extra's `juniper-recurrence` ceiling to admit the released next minor:
  `juniper-recurrence>=0.2.0,<0.5.0` (0.4.0 on PyPI). Supersedes dependabot #1323, which cannot
  co-update the `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` lint contract; the contract and the extras tables in
  `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md`, and `docs/REFERENCE.md` move in lockstep — the same
  handling the v0.7.1 widening gave dependabot #900/#901. No other ceiling moves: recurrence 0.4.0's
  own pins (`juniper-recurrence-model<0.3.0,>=0.1.5`, `juniper-service-core<0.6.0,>=0.5.0`,
  `juniper-model-core[crossval]<0.4.0,>=0.2.0`, `juniper-data-client<0.5.0,>=0.4.2`) all resolve inside
  what this package already declares, so `pip install juniper-ml[recurrence]` stays satisfiable.
  `juniper-recurrence-client` stays at `<0.3.0` (no newer release).
- `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-14_touchup_lane_probe.py` and `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-14_signing_arc_status.py`
  moved to `util/ad-hoc/retired/` with the `_RETIRED-2026-08-14` suffix (the #928 precedent), their
  purposes being complete: the touch-up fan-out landed in all 8 repos with the lane, and
  `juniper-cascor` 0.9.0 published to PyPI. Their headers now record the answers they produced rather
  than a "retire when" condition already met.

- **Editable-install drift check now detects stale metadata**, a second axis orthogonal to
  `FRESH` / `WORKTREE_PINNED` / `ORPHANED` (`util/editable_install_drift_check.py`). An editable
  install never re-derives its version when the source tree moves on: `import` follows the live
  tree, but `*.dist-info/METADATA` stays frozen at whatever was declared when pip last ran. The
  path axis cannot see that, and neither can `juniper-env-drift-check`, which asks a different
  question — whether an installed version satisfies a consumer's declared *floor*. A stale
  editable sits comfortably above every floor and is still wrong.
  - Found on this host on 2026-08-14: **7 of 8** editable installs were `FRESH` **and** stale at
    once, `juniper-data` five minors behind (`0.6.0` recorded vs `0.11.0` declared). Both existing
    checkers reported completely clean. The consequence is not a broken `import` — it is anything
    reading the *installed* version: juniper-cascor's own `test_version_matches_pyproject` failed
    locally on exactly this (`0.6.0` vs pyproject `0.9.0`), and a host-launched service exports the
    stale number as its build-info/provenance metric.
  - New per-finding fields `installed_version` / `source_version` / `version_status`
    (`MATCH` | `STALE` | `UNKNOWN`) in the table, the summary, and `--json`. `STALE` is **soft**
    (exit `0` — `import` still resolves); `--strict-version` makes it exit `1`, and `--strict` is
    unchanged, still about the path axis alone.
  - `--fix-stale` refreshes stale installs against the path they **already point at**
    (`drift: "stale-metadata"`), not a canonical-discovery result — reinstalling from the recorded
    path is what re-stamps the metadata, while routing it through discovery could re-point a
    deliberate checkout. `ORPHANED` repair is untouched (`drift: "path"`).
  - Dynamic versions resolve only from an **explicit** declaration
    (`[tool.setuptools.dynamic] version.attr`, including `src/` layouts, or `[tool.hatch.version] path`).
    An unrecognized backend reports `UNKNOWN` rather than guessing at a plausible `_version.py`,
    so the tool cannot manufacture a `STALE` finding from the wrong file.
  - Coverage: `tests/test_editable_install_drift_check.py::VersionDriftTest` (18 arms, hermetic —
    synthetic conda dir + ecosystem root, no real pip).

### Fixed

- **Runner-commit automations no longer produce unsigned, unmergeable branches** (juniper-ml#1099).
  The 2026-08-12 branch-protection normalization added `required_signatures` to every repo, and a
  local `git commit` on a runner is unsigned — an unsigned commit *anywhere* in a branch's history
  blocks the merge, and squash does not rescue it. juniper-ml#1096 fixed this for `propose.py`; the
  remaining lanes are fixed here. Live repro: [juniper-cascor#518](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/pull/518),
  the `juniper-cascor v0.9.0` proposal — 20/20 checks green, zero review threads, `mergeable: MERGEABLE`,
  and still `BLOCKED` on one unsigned lockfile commit.
  - `.github/workflows/agents-md-touch-up.yml` — **verifies** `**Last Updated**:` instead of rewriting
    the branch. The value must be a well-formed `YYYY-MM-DD`, not in the future, and either already
    equal to today's UTC date or changed in the PR; a missing field warns and passes. This kills two
    failure classes at once: the unsigned commit above, and the `[skip ci]` orphan — the old bump
    commit became the PR head and, because it carried `[skip ci]`, **no required context ever reported
    on it**, leaving the PR permanently BLOCKED with every check stuck at "expected"
    ([cascor#515](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/pull/515)). It also stops the lane racing
    `Update Lockfile (Dependabot)` for the push slot. Permissions drop from `contents: write` to
    `contents: read`, the fork guard is gone (verification needs no token), and the job is renamed
    `Verify AGENTS.md Last Updated` (it is not a required context on any repo). The predicate is
    "changed *or* already today" rather than "equals today" so a PR spanning several days keeps
    passing on re-run.
  - `.github/workflows/lockfile-update.yml` — `peter-evans/create-pull-request` now runs with
    `sign-commits: true`, so the weekly `chore/lockfile-update` PR is mergeable.
  - `tests/test_agents_md_touch_up.py` rewritten for the verify contract (12 arms), including an
    **anti-resurrection** assertion that the extracted shell can never `git commit` / `git push` /
    `sed -i` / `git add` again, and a rehearsal arm pinning the already-today case.

### Added

- `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-14_signed_workflow_pr.py` — opens a PR on any Juniper repo whose commit is
  created through `createCommitOnBranch` and is therefore GitHub-signed. Used to land the #1099
  fan-out, and it dogfoods the mechanism it ships.
- `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-14_touchup_lane_probe.py` — reports, per repo, whether the touch-up lane
  exists, its job name, whether that name is a **required** context (renaming a required context
  would hang every PR), and whether it still mutates. Distinguishes a 404 from a transient fetch
  failure so a flaky network can never be read as "this repo has no lane".
- `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-14_signing_arc_status.py` — cross-repo merge-readiness board used to land the
  #1099 fan-out. Its `MERGE-OK` column is the reusable part: a green check rollup is **not** grounds
  to merge, so it additionally requires contexts that actually **ran** (a PR whose checks never
  reported also shows no failures — the `[skip ci]` orphan class), zero unresolved review threads
  (`gh pr checks` does not surface them; ml#1096 sat BLOCKED on one with 18/18 green), every commit
  signed, and `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN` (`BEHIND`/`BLOCKED` are invisible in the rollup). Counts
  come from the GraphQL rollup because the installed `gh pr checks` has no `--json`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Meta-package TestPyPI publish verification switched to the two-phase form** (#1038):
  phase 1 downloads the exact version from TestPyPI with `--no-deps` (artifact
  provenance); phase 2 installs the downloaded wheel's `bare`/`[clients]`/`[tools]`
  extras with dependencies resolved from PyPI **only** — a single index, so a
  TestPyPI squatter can no longer shadow a real dependency (the `fastapi 1.0`
  dependency-confusion failure that blocked the v0.7.0 publish). The TestPyPI
  upload step now passes `skip-existing`.

### Note

- `v0.7.0` was tagged and uploaded to TestPyPI, but its publish failed at the
  verification gate and the tag name was permanently retired by release
  immutability — 0.7.1 is the first published release of the 0.7.0 content.

### Changed

- `util/experiments/run_experiment.py`: the G-6 staging alias map gains `gaussian` and `checkerboard` (W-3 landed in juniper-cascor#490, including the server-side `n_samples`→`n_samples_per_class` gaussian translation), retiring the driver's W-3 refusal hint; generators outside the map (arc_agi, csv_import, the 3-D sequence family) now refuse with a §10.3 scope message. Tests updated (gaussian stages; arc_agi refusal arm).


### Fixed

- `util/release_train/propose.py` — the AGENTS.md co-change now also bumps a repo's **per-package version TABLE row** (juniper-ml#851, issue option 2 — the generic table heuristic). juniper-recurrence's `AGENTS.md:22-24` sub-package table is pinned against each package's `_version.py` by a repo-local `version-drift` pre-commit hook (`scripts/check_version_drift.py`), and the train knew only about the `**Version**:` header (the ml#706 / worker#140 precedent), so every recurrence proposal shipped red in that repo and was healed by hand ([recurrence#92](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-recurrence/pull/92) / [#93](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-recurrence/pull/93)). New `set_agents_table_version` rewrites the version cell of any `|`-row that names the released `pypi_name` as a backtick-delimited token and carries exactly one standalone version cell — name-anchored and structured like `apply_pin_edits_agents_table`, with the same honesty rules as the header path: already-at-target is silent success, no such table is no phantom edit and no checklist noise, and an unexpected/ambiguous cell is left byte-untouched and surfaced `REQUIRED` on the co-change checklist rather than guessed at. Because the table is per-PACKAGE where the header is per-REPO, a sub-package (`juniper-recurrence-model`) bumps its own row without ever touching the host repo's primary-tracking header. `build_proposal` now reads `AGENTS.md` **once** and composes the header, table-row, and extras-pin true-ups into a **single** `FileEdit` (the executor writes each edit's full text in order, so two edits on one path would have silently dropped the first). Prose version mentions (`AGENTS.md:118`) are deliberately untouched — the target repo's hook does not gate prose. `tests/test_release_train_propose.py` grows a table-bearing sibling fixture mirroring the real recurrence shape plus 18 tests (113 → 131); operator triage in the release-train runbook (Gate 1 review § version TABLE row).

### Added

- `tests/test_experiment_config_schemas.py` (plan §10.6 row 3, Wave 3.5): the drift gate over the sibling repos' shipped `conf/experiments/*.yaml` (cascor Wave 3.2 / recurrence Wave 3.4) — each file must load through the driver's §5.6 `load_config` and every `service:` key must name a real app `Settings` field, AST-extracted from the sibling's `settings.py` (+ the in-repo service-core `SettingsBase`) so no app import is needed. Gated like the other cross-repo drift tests; the extractor self-check always runs.

### Changed

- `util/experiment_stack.bash`: the `--config` staging is no longer app-side-inert — with Waves 3.1/3.3 merged, the launcher now also exports `JUNIPER_RECURRENCE_CONFIG_FILE` at the staged copy for `--recurrence` runs (cascor's export already existed), and the "no `--config` flag yet" note is retired. Neither launch passes an app `--config` flag: the env var is the threading mechanism, so the launcher CLI keeps owning the bind (§5.2). Test pin updated (`test_recurrence_config_threads_env_var_not_flag`).


### Added

- `util/experiments/stats_summary.py` + driver wiring (plan §8.3, Wave 2.6): every run now writes `artifacts/results/stats.json` and a human-readable `summary.md` (stdlib-only; rendered for every outcome, including stalled/failed runs) — identity/dataset-shape/outcome-timing blocks from the manifest, cascor candidate-correlation-per-round and `training_step_duration` p50/p95 derived from the driver's own `metrics_series.csv` (honestly labeled as per-poll means — true per-step quantiles are not recoverable from a sum/count exposition), the recurrence train/CV/θ/readout block, and §8.3 provenance/health degraded-mode notes (G-3 sampling, collect errors, plot skips, eval-disabled, G-6). A stats failure is recorded as `stats_error` on the manifest rather than killing it. Tests grow to 92.

- `util/experiments/plots_recurrence.py` + driver wiring (plan §8.2, Wave 2.5 — closes G-5): the recurrence plot set rendered client-side — `dataset_overview.png` (sampled 3-D windows with the target starred), `dt_histogram.png` (per-step Δt + `target_dt`, the irregularity signature), `forecast_vs_truth.png` / `residuals.png` (predict response vs the predict split's target with the `y_reg_{split}`-preferred key rule and an optional residual-vs-`target_dt` panel), `crossval_folds.png` (per-fold eval bars + aggregate line), `metrics_table.png` (train + CV ± std). Disabled/failed predict or crossval phases and non-Δt artifacts are recorded per-plot skips; the recurrence manifest `driver.plots` stub is replaced with the real requested/rendered/skipped record. No training-history plot by design (`TrainResponse` carries no per-epoch series). Tests grow to 86 with a 3-D sequence stub artifact.

- `util/experiments/plots_cascor.py` + driver wiring (plan §8.1, Wave 2.4): the cascor plot set rendered client-side from collected payloads — `dataset.png` (fetched NPZ artifact; 2-feature generators), `decision_boundary.png` (real `grid_x`/`grid_y`/`predictions` payload contract + sample overlay), `training_history.png` (hidden-unit-insertion markers), `candidate_correlation.png` (from the driver's own `metrics_series.csv`, the sole correlation source), `eval_metrics.png` (scalar bars). `outputs.plots` is now validated per app kind (§8.1 vs §8.2 name sets); structurally-unavailable data is a recorded per-plot skip while render errors / missing matplotlib on requested plots fail acceptance; the manifest gains a `driver.plots` requested/rendered/skipped record. Never imports cascor (its plotter imports torch); matplotlib loads lazily on the Agg backend. Tests grow to 78 (plot e2e + renderer units); `ci.yml` installs matplotlib.

- `util/experiments/run_experiment.py` recurrence path (plan §6.3 step 4 *recurrence* + §5.5, Wave 2.3): §5.5 block validation (`dataset.split`, `train:` LMU hyperparameters, `crossval:`, `predict:`), the synchronous `POST /v1/train` drive with the Q-2 budget enforced as the request's socket timeout (`timed_out` distinct from unreachable), optional `POST /v1/predict` / `POST /v1/crossval` by content-addressed `dataset_id` ref (crossval reuses the train hyperparameters for bench comparability; failures are recorded and the run continues to the manifest), and the G-18 `outputs.save_model` re-run of the `juniper-recurrence train` CLI (`--dataset <dataset_id>` + identical flags + `--out`, manifest-recorded). `tests/test_run_experiment.py` grows the recurrence arms (66 tests total).

- `util/experiments/run_experiment.py` — single-run experiment driver for the CLI experimentation program (plan §6.3, Wave 2.2: the cascor service path). Validates the experiment YAML (§5.6 driver-owned subset incl. the mandatory `experiment.seed` and rule-6 infra-key rejection), preflights the generator, creates the dataset on the run's juniper-data (content-addressed `dataset_id`), drives `POST /v1/training/start` → polls to `COMPLETED`/`FAILED` under the Q-2 wall-clock budget + stall detector, samples the loopback `/metrics` allowlist into `metrics_series.csv` each poll (F-1 redirect-following; candidate correlation exists only there), stages non-spiral generators with a post-run G-6 shape assert, collects results (`metrics_final.json`, `metrics_history.json`, `topology.json`, `decision_boundary.npz`, optional snapshot), always writes the §13.4 `manifest.json`, and honours the documented 0–4 exit-code contract. The recurrence path lands in Wave 2.3; plot rendering in Wave 2.4.
- `tests/test_run_experiment.py` — hermetic gate for the driver (a scripted stub HTTP server stands in for juniper-data + cascor; 50 tests across YAML validation, drive-loop outcomes, staging, manifest schema, and the exit matrix), wired into `ci.yml`, which now also installs `numpy` for the `.npz` round-trip.

### Changed

- Widened the `recurrence` extra's ceilings to admit the released next minors: `juniper-recurrence-model>=0.1.5,<0.3.0` (0.2.0 on PyPI) and `juniper-recurrence>=0.2.0,<0.4.0` (0.3.0 on PyPI, whose own pin admits recurrence-model 0.2.x). Supersedes dependabot #900/#901, which cannot co-update the `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` lint contract; the contract and the extras tables in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md`, and `docs/REFERENCE.md` move in lockstep. `juniper-recurrence-client` stays at `<0.3.0` (no newer release).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- **Release-train ceremony (`util/release_train/ceremony.py`) — the exempt notes-archive PR's commit is now GitHub-signed (created through the GitHub API), so the exempt PR auto-merges hands-free.** The archive lane no longer branches/commits/pushes with runner-side git; instead `open_archive_pr` creates `refs/heads/release-notes/<pkg>-v<ver>` via a REST `POST /repos/pcalnon/juniper-ml/git/refs` (`create_branch`) and adds the single archive file via the GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch` mutation (`create_signed_commit`; single-file addition, `expectedHeadOid` for optimistic concurrency, base64 content). A commit made through GitHub's API under the App / `GITHUB_TOKEN` identity is **GitHub-signed and Verified**, so the exempt archive PR satisfies the juniper-ml ruleset's `required_signatures` rule and **auto-merges with zero clicks** — a plain unsigned runner-side commit previously left an all-green archive PR BLOCKED behind that rule (2026-07-23 run 30051952226 / ml#707, resolved only by the owner's admin one-click); owner one-click is now only the degraded/manual fallback, with **no security-posture change** (the PyPI deploy still waits at the owner-gated `pypi` environment, Gate 2). The R7 seam keeps `api` forbidden for the general surface and sanctions **exactly** those two calls, each bound to the 8 publishing repos: `_assert_gh_allowed` dispatches an `api` argv to the new `_assert_api_allowed`, which accepts only a `repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs` POST creating a `refs/heads/*` ref, or an `api graphql` body containing `createCommitOnBranch` with `repoWithOwner` bound, and rejects any other path/mutation/repo (a stray `gh api environments/…` still raises `SeamViolation`). The archive is always in juniper-ml (plan §10.2), where both token modes hold `contents: write`, so the API path is unconditional (no local-git fallback). Because the API path never switches the operator's checkout, the (unreleased) 2026-07-19 branch capture/restore rough-edge fix is removed as moot — git is now used only for READS in the archive lane (freshen `origin/main`, resolve the base sha, inspect an existing branch for idempotent re-entry: reuse at base, reuse the single archive commit, or HALT on divergence). Hermetic coverage in `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py` replaces the branch-restore tests with the signed-commit lane (the two api-call argv shapes, base64 content round-trip, `expectedHeadOid` threading, branch-exists re-entry reuse/re-commit/HALT, and the `_assert_api_allowed` positive/negative carve-out); `--dry-run` stays byte-identical (`git status` clean). `.github/workflows/release-train.yml` is unchanged (the ceremony job already holds `contents: write` on juniper-ml); `propose.py` proposal PRs are owner-merged and unaffected (a possible future consistency follow-up). **No ceremony runs live in this change** — hermetic tests + `--dry-run` only; the live proof (an archive PR auto-merging with zero clicks) rides the next real ceremony dispatch.
- **Notes-migration ad-hoc scripts retired.** The four one-off migration scripts (`2026-07-04_notes_rename_{convention,refupdate,context_revert,sibling_links}.py`) moved to `util/ad-hoc/retired/` with a `_RETIRED-2026-07-06` suffix per the `util/ad-hoc/` lifecycle, now that every migration PR (juniper-ml#620/#626 + the 7 sibling link-fix PRs) is merged and verified. The old→new mapping TSV stays in place as the durable record; the convention doc's migration-record section points at the retired paths.
- **Notes loose-ends cleanup (follow-up to the naming migration).** The 13 pre-existing stale citations in `notes/requirements/id_assignments.yaml` (and their echoes in the by-area/by-repo/by-status views) are repointed to the files' current homes — three juniper-ml docs long since archived to `notes/legacy/` (`CONVERGENCE_UI_FIX_PLAN`, `REMAINING_ISSUES_REMEDIATION_PLAN`, `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_AND_UPGRADE_PLAN`) and one juniper-cascor doc that moved from `notes/history/` to `notes/pull_requests/` — taking the requirements drift checker to zero findings. The obsolete scratch file `notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-02_JUNIPER-CANOPY_TEMP.md` (ex-`temp.md`, flagged by the 2026-06-21 docs-reality audit) is deleted.
- **`notes/` file naming convention adopted + 251 files renamed.** Every document in `notes/` (except the exempt `templates/`, `releases/`, `requirements/`, `legacy/` subdirectories and README files) now follows `JUNIPER_<YYYY-MM-DD>_JUNIPER-<REPO>_<CONTENTS-DESCRIPTION-PHRASE>.md`, where REPO is one of ML / CANOPY / RECURRENCE / CASCOR / CASCOR-CLIENT / CASCOR-WORKER / DATA / DATA-CLIENT / DEPLOY / ECOSYSTEM (ECOSYSTEM = cross-repo/platform-wide). Dates were taken from the old filename when present, else the file's last git-commit date. All ~7,000 in-repo references (markdown links, workflow comments, `id_assignments.yaml` citations, test/util docstrings) were rewritten in the same branch; the planner/auditor agents and the plan/audit/code-review prompt templates now emit the new name shape. Convention source of truth: `notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-04_JUNIPER-ML_NOTES-FILE-NAMING-CONVENTION.md`; full old→new mapping: `util/ad-hoc/2026-07-04_notes_rename_map.tsv`.
- **DP-3 follow-up: `[recurrence]` extra app + client pins bumped to `>=0.2.0,<0.3.0`; model floor tightened to `>=0.1.5,<0.2.0`.** Now that `juniper-recurrence` 0.2.0 and `juniper-recurrence-client` 0.2.0 are published to PyPI — the releases that expose the full DP-3 readout spectrum (`linear` / `rff` / `mlp`) plus `ridge="gcv"` over the HTTP / CLI / client edge — the `[recurrence]` extra (and thus `[all]`) bumps both pins from `>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` to `>=0.2.0,<0.3.0`, so `pip install juniper-ml[recurrence]` resolves the new edge features. The `juniper-recurrence-model` pin is **also bumped from `>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` to `>=0.1.5,<0.2.0`** to match the real floor: `juniper-recurrence` 0.2.0 itself requires `juniper-recurrence-model>=0.1.5` (the 0.1.5 `MLPReadoutSpec` the `readout="mlp"` edge needs), so the meta-package's declared floor now reflects the effective floor instead of understating it. Publish-first follow-up to the 0.2.0 releases; the matching lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep (RK-11).
- **R5: new `[recurrence]` extra — the Δt-native recurrence stack.** Adds a dedicated `recurrence` optional-dependency group pinning `juniper-recurrence-model>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (the closed-form variable-Δt LMU regressor on the `juniper-model-core` `TrainableModel` seam) `juniper-recurrence>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (the FastAPI/CLI application that wraps it), and `juniper-recurrence-client>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (the HTTP client for that service, DEP-8), now that all three are published to PyPI (WS-4 / WS-4b). `[all]` aggregates it, so `pip install juniper-ml[recurrence]` / `[all]` resolves the recurrence model + app + client. The matching lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep (RK-11); the `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` / `docs/QUICK_START.md` / `docs/REFERENCE.md` extras tables pick up the new row.
- **WS-3 follow-up: `juniper-model-core` added to the `[tools]` extra (and thus `[all]`).** Now that `juniper-model-core` 0.1.0 is published to PyPI, `[tools]` pins `juniper-model-core>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (capped per the pre-1.0 convention), so `pip install juniper-ml[tools]` / `[all]` resolves the shared model-contract package. This is the deferred, publish-first follow-up to juniper-ml#416 (the package scaffold), which intentionally withheld extras wiring until the package was on PyPI. The matching lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep (RK-11), and a new `tests/test_model_core_drift.py` guards the pin against future version drift.
- **WS-2 follow-up: `juniper-service-core` added to the `[tools]` extra (and thus `[all]`).** Now that `juniper-service-core` 0.1.0 is published to PyPI, `[tools]` pins `juniper-service-core>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (capped per the pre-1.0 convention), so `pip install juniper-ml[tools]` / `[all]` resolves the shared service-tier framework package (FastAPI app factory, settings base, security/middleware, `TrainingLifecycle`). This is the deferred, publish-first follow-up to the WS-2 merges (juniper-ml#417/#419/#420/#422), which withheld extras wiring until the package was on PyPI. The matching lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep (RK-11), and a new `tests/test_service_core_drift.py` guards the pin against future version drift; both it and the pre-existing `tests/test_model_core_drift.py` (added in #418 but never wired into `ci.yml`) now run in CI. The `README.md` / `docs/QUICK_START.md` `[tools]` tables also pick up the `juniper-model-core` entry that #418 had omitted.
- **E.3 (juniper-ml STACK_REGRESSION_CORRECTIONS_2026-05-27 §E.3)**: `[clients]` extra now pins `juniper-cascor-client>=0.5.0` (was `>=0.4.0`). The 0.5.0 release adds the `origin=` keyword argument to `CascorTrainingStream` and `CascorControlStream`, forwarded to `websockets.connect(..., origin=…)` — required by juniper-canopy to connect to cascor's fail-closed `/ws/control` allowlist (juniper-cascor#129) from inside docker compose. Without bumping this pin, downstream `pip install juniper-ml[clients]` (or `[all]`) installations would still resolve to `juniper-cascor-client 0.4.x`, which lacks the `origin=` kwarg, and any consumer threading an Origin through `CascorControlStream(origin=…)` would `TypeError` at runtime. Companion PRs in this cascade: juniper-deploy#101 (✅ merged 2026-05-29), juniper-canopy#327 (✅ merged 2026-05-29), juniper-cascor-client#69, juniper-cascor#312, juniper-canopy#328, juniper-deploy#102. The matching lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep.

### Added

- **Release-train Phase 4.3: full `off|report|propose|ceremony` mode switch + operator runbook + rollback (`release-train.yml`, `util/release_train/ceremony.py`).** Implements step 4.3 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§8 / §9.3-9.4 / §11 / §12 step 4.3). `ceremony` mode is now **wired** (it no longer degrades to `report`): a second write-scoped `ceremony` job — `needs: detect`, `if: needs.detect.outputs.mode == 'ceremony'`, identical `permissions: {contents: write, pull-requests: write}` + its own App-token mint step + sibling clones — runs `util/release_train/ceremony.py --execute --monitor-timeout 900` and renders a ceremony step summary (ceremonies / resume-monitors / HALTs / `PENDING_PYPI_APPROVAL`). Mode resolution accepts all four values (precedence: dispatch input > repo variable `RELEASE_TRAIN_MODE` > `report`); an unknown value warns and degrades to `report`; **`off` fully quiesces** (nothing runs beyond mode resolution). `ceremony.py` gains **graceful HALT-issue degradation** (`_file_halt_issue`): a failed `gh issue create/edit` during a HALT upsert — most plausibly the cross-repo App token lacking the Issues permission — degrades to a loud log line + a step-summary `halt_issue_failed` flag instead of crashing the run (a `SeamViolation` code bug still propagates; the R7 gh surface is unchanged), and `--execute` now emits one stable machine-parseable `ceremony-result:` line per package for the step summary. New operator runbook [`notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-22_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_RELEASE-TRAIN-OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md`](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-22_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_RELEASE-TRAIN-OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md): the four modes + what each writes, mode-resolution precedence, the daily-cron / propose / ceremony cheat-sheet, the two owner gates, the §8 HALT catalog with responses, rollback procedures (`RELEASE_TRAIN_MODE=off`, deleting a bad Release/tag, closing a bad proposal, the immutable-index stance), and the App identity + R7 in operator terms (every claim cited to `file:line` / `§section`). `tests/test_release_train_workflow_guard.py` extends to pin both write jobs (perms, mode gates, mint-only App secret referenced exactly once per write job, off-quiescence) and **rehearses the actual workflow snippets** — the mode-resolution shell over the full matrix and the ceremony summary Python over a synthetic output — via the YAML-extraction pattern; `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py` adds the HALT-issue-degradation unit + end-to-end coverage and the `ceremony-result:` output-format tests. **No cross-repo ceremony runs live in this change** — hermetic tests + `--dry-run` only; the owner triggers the pilot post-merge.
- **Release-train Phase 4.2: dependency-ordered scheduling + consumer ceiling-bump follow-on PRs (`util/release_train/propose.py`).** Implements step 4.2 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§13 / §5.4 / §6 / §12 step 4.2). (1) **Dependency-aware ordering.** When multiple packages are eligible in one run, `propose.py` now processes them **upstream-first** via a deterministic topological sort of the registry `depends_on` DAG (`topological_order`, Kahn's algorithm with a lexicographic `pypi_name` tie-break — derived from the registry, NOT hardcoded tiers; shared libs → sub-libs → apps → meta, with `juniper-ml` last); a cyclic `depends_on` graph is a hard invocation error (exit 2) naming the cycle (`CycleError`). (2) **Ceiling-bump follow-on PRs (D6).** Each propagation edge is annotated with a `consumer_pin_state` (`within_range` / `floor_only` / `escaped -> follow-on` / `escaped -> skipped(<reason>)`) read from the consumer's REAL pyproject on disk (both floor-only and `<ceiling` forms; the PEP 508 `[extras]` marker, e.g. `juniper-model-core[crossval]>=…`, is tolerated); for each escaped cross-repo consumer it builds a **standard-gated** ceiling-bump follow-on PR in that consumer's repo — the pin edit (ceiling raised to the upstream's next-minor, floors preserved byte-for-byte), branch `deps/<upstream>-ceiling-<new-ceiling>`, and a body citing §13 + the triggering proposal — **never** folded into the upstream proposal or the exempt notes-archive path (the 2026-07-06 ci-tools incident class; rec#85 is the hand-made shape). Cross-repo capability (Phase 4.1) gates the open (`escaped -> follow-on` when `--cross-repo` with the sibling checked out, else `escaped -> skipped`), and a per-consumer-repo dup-guard suppresses a duplicate. The meta (`juniper-ml`) never gets a follow-on: its pin rides #661's folded co-change when the upstream is in-repo and stays MANUAL (Q-META) otherwise. (3) The proposal JSON/report + PR body surface the per-run propagation picture (`follow_on_prs`, `consumer_pin_state`). Hermetic coverage in `tests/test_release_train_propose.py` (topological order over the real registry + a synthetic cycle → exit 2; the §12-4.2 verify — a simulated upstream MINOR bump produces the expected edges + follow-on content; escaped / within-range / floor-only / extras-form pins; degraded-mode skip; per-repo dup-guard; dry-run writes nothing). **No cross-repo write runs live in this change** — hermetic tests + `--dry-run` only.
- **Release-train Phase 4.1: cross-repo write identity + cross-repo `propose`/`ceremony` (`release-train.yml`, `util/release_train/propose.py`, `util/release_train/ceremony.py`).** Implements step 4.1 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§9.2–9.4 / §10.2 / §12 step 4.1). The `propose` job now mints a **GitHub App installation token** (`actions/create-github-app-token`, SHA-pinned `bcd2ba4` / v3.2.0) scoped to the 8 publishing repos and passes `propose.py --cross-repo`; `propose.py` replaces its hard `WRITABLE_REPO` guard with **capability-based** logic — given that cross-repo token and an on-disk sibling checkout (`--ecosystem-root`), a sibling package's proposal branches from that repo's `origin/main`, edits that checkout (the write/git seam is now **repo-aware**), pushes with the App token, and opens the PR **in the sibling repo** (the dup-guard runs per-repo); without the capability it skips siblings with the same clear reason as before (the degraded single-repo `GITHUB_TOKEN` path). The in-repo meta consumer-pin co-changes (#661 RK-11 lockstep) stay juniper-ml-only — a sibling proposal emits the §13 propagation edge instead of editing the meta from a sibling checkout. `ceremony.py` gains the same capability gate and a **repo split** (plan §10.2): the exempt notes-archive PR is **always** opened centrally in juniper-ml (`plan.archive_repo`) while the Release is cut on the **owning** repo (`gh release create --repo pcalnon/<repo>`) and that repo's publish run monitored; its R7 seam (`_assert_gh_allowed`) now bounds every `--repo` to the 8 publishing repos (registry-derived via `publishing_repo_slugs`) **without widening the verb allowlist**, and `create_release` renders the `--notes-file` to a scratch temp path instead of the checkout (the 07-19 stray-untracked-file fix). **Graceful degradation is mandatory**: the mint step is gated on the repo variable `RELEASE_TRAIN_APP_ID` (owner-provisioned with the `RELEASE_TRAIN_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret); when unset the job falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` and skips siblings. The App private-key secret is referenced **only** in the mint step and the minted token **only** in the propose job — pinned by `tests/test_release_train_workflow_guard.py`, whose `ALLOWED_SECRETS` allowlist is deliberately extended for `RELEASE_TRAIN_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. Because App-created PRs trigger CI normally, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` no-checks caveat now applies **only** to the degraded no-App path (AGENTS.md + the workflow header updated accordingly). Hermetic coverage extends `tests/test_release_train_propose.py` (cross-repo opens in the sibling with the correct branch/base, no meta edits from a sibling context, degraded-path skip preserved) and `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py` (cross-repo archive-in-juniper-ml while `release create` carries `--repo <owning>`; seam `--repo` accept/reject; temp-path notes render). **No cross-repo write runs live in this change** — hermetic tests + `--dry-run` only; the owner triggers the pilot post-merge.
- **Release-train Phase 3.2: exempt-archive + Release ceremony engine (`util/release_train/ceremony.py`).** Implements step 3.2 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§5.3 / §7 / §8 / §9.3 / §10). For each `BUMPED_NOT_RELEASED` package the detector reports (in-repo / juniper-ml only this phase — the `WRITABLE_REPO` guard reused from `propose.py`; sibling repos are skipped with a clear reason, deferred to Phase 4's GitHub App identity), the engine: (1) runs the §8 preconditions — target `main` CI green, the `declared >= released` re-check against live PyPI truth, a non-empty `CHANGELOG [<version>]` section, and (in the monitor) TestPyPI install-verify success — each failure **HALTs that package** with a deduplicated GitHub-issue payload (title keyed on `pypi_name` + reason), never blocking the others; (2) builds the FINAL central notes file via `notes_render` from the released package's `CHANGELOG [<version>]` section (`archive_name` from `registry.yaml`); (3) opens the exempt add-only, single-file archive PR (the diff the Phase 3.1 guard proves); (4) enables `gh pr merge --auto --squash` on it, **degrading gracefully** to the owner one-click merge when `allow_auto_merge` is off (step 3.3 has not landed — that is *not* a HALT); (5) cuts `gh release create <tag> --latest=false --notes-file <archive>` — the Release **creates** the sub-package tag (procedure §11.4), so there is deliberately **no** `--verify-tag`; (6) monitors the triggered publish run and reports the terminal state `PENDING_PYPI_APPROVAL` — the run legitimately parks at the owner-gated `pypi` environment, which **is success for the train**. The **R7 write-identity invariant (§9.3) is enforced in code**: every `gh` call is routed through `_assert_gh_allowed`, which permits exactly `{pr create, pr merge --auto, release create, run list/view, issue create/edit}` and rejects any `api` / environment / deployment / reviewer mutation, a bare `pr merge` without `--auto`, or a `release create --verify-tag`; `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py` asserts the live seam's actual surface matches. **Idempotent re-entry** (§8): a re-run re-computes state from PyPI/Release truth — already-released is a no-op, an existing Release resumes at the monitor, and an open archive PR / already-archived file is reused, never duplicated. **`--dry-run` is the default and prints the full ceremony script of actions while writing nothing**; `--execute` exists but is not run against the real repo in this change. `util/` is not pre-commit-lint-gated, so the new hermetic unittest is the gate, wired into `ci.yml`. The live end-to-end (a real low-risk sub-package bump — `juniper-service-core` 0.5.0 is queued as exactly that payload) is owner-triggered **after** the step-3.3 auto-merge preconditions land.
- **Release-train Phase 3.1: structural archive-guard for the exempt notes-archive PR (`util/release_train/archive_guard.py` + `ci.yml` guard lane).** Implements step 3.1 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§7.2 / R5): the required-CI-job CHECK that proves the release-train's ONE gate-exempt PR — the one that archives the generated release notes and contains *no other change* — really is exactly that, so it can (later, step 3.3) auto-merge behind a required status check without leaking any code/config change past the owner gate. The path-invokable module computes a PR's changed-file set (`git diff --name-status <base>...<head>`, injected so the tests are hermetic) and passes ONLY if all four rules hold: **add-only** (every change status `A`), **path-confined** (each added path `^notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_.*\.md$`), **name-valid** (each filename `RELEASE_NOTES_v<semver>.md` meta / `RELEASE_NOTES_<pkg>_v<semver>.md` else, `<pkg>` a registry `pypi_name`, per procedure §11.3), and **single-purpose** (nothing else in the diff). A PR that does not touch `notes/releases/` is `SKIP` (passes), so the guard never blocks a normal PR; a violation merely fails the check (exit 1) and the PR falls back to the standard owner gate — the guard opens/merges nothing and mutates no environment (R7). A new PR-only `release-train-archive-guard` job in `ci.yml` runs it (standalone, so the owner can later mark it a required status check in the branch ruleset). New hermetic gate `tests/test_release_train_archive_guard.py` proves a pure notes-add passes and modify / delete / out-of-path / bad-name / mixed diffs each fail; `util/` is not pre-commit-lint-gated, so that unittest is the gate. No ceremony/auto-merge behaviour ships here (that is step 3.2); this is the guard alone.
- **Release-train Phase 2.2: `propose` mode wired into `release-train.yml` (opt-in, in-repo pilot).** Implements step 2.2 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§9.3 / §12 step 2.2). A **two-job privilege split** preserves the R7 write-identity invariant: the `detect` job keeps the workflow-level `contents: read` and now runs for both `report` and `propose` (detection is common) while exposing the resolved mode as a job output; a new **write-scoped `propose` job** — `permissions: {contents: write, pull-requests: write}`, `if: needs.detect.outputs.mode == 'propose'` (so the write scope is unreachable off the propose path) — downloads the release-manifest artifact and runs `util/release_train/propose.py --execute` to open **standard-gated** release-proposal PRs, never touching environments, deployments, Releases, or (Test)PyPI. `off`/`report`/`propose` are all valid modes now; only `ceremony` still degrades to `report`. A new `packages` dispatch input (whitespace/comma-separated pypi_names, validated against the pypi-name charset; empty = all eligible) restricts which packages are proposed. `propose.py` gains a **cross-repo guard**: under `--execute` a package whose registry `repo` is not `juniper-ml` is skipped with a clear reason (the single-repo `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot open cross-repo PRs; cross-repo is Phase 4), and its commit passes `-c commit.gpgsign=false` (the job also runs `git config commit.gpgsign false`) so the headless runner never trips the owner's YubiKey signing config. New guards: `tests/test_release_train_workflow_guard.py` pins the R7 boundary (workflow-level `contents: read`; propose-job perms exactly `{contents: write, pull-requests: write}`; the mode-gated `if`; only `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` referenced), and `tests/test_release_train_propose.py` covers the cross-repo skip + the gpgsign fix; both are wired into `ci.yml`. **Known limitation** (accepted for the pilot): PRs opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger CI (GitHub's recursion guard), so a proposal PR shows no checks until the owner re-triggers (close/reopen, or push an empty commit); Phase 4's GitHub App resolves this. The real pilot dispatch (`gh workflow run release-train.yml -f mode=propose -f packages=<one>`) is owner-run post-merge.
- **Release-train Phase 2.1: proposal-PR generator (`util/release_train/propose.py` + `notes_render.py`).** Implements step 2.1 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) (§5.4 / §6 / §10.1): consumes the Phase 1.2 detector's release-manifest JSON (`detect.py --json`) and, for each `UNRELEASED_CHANGES` package, generates the complete **standard-gated** release-proposal PR content — the version bump (`[project].version` for static packages, `_version.py` `__version__` for the four dynamic ones), the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` → `[<version>] - <date>` move (a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` left behind), a template-driven release-notes draft (`notes_render.py`, sourced from `TEMPLATE_RELEASE_NOTES.md` or the security template when a `Security` category is present; **not** archived to `notes/releases/` — archival is the later exempt ceremony step), the meta-package `AGENTS.md` `**Version**` co-change, the §5.4 co-change checklist, and the `propagation_edges` (a pre-1.0 MINOR bump escapes a consumer's `<next-minor` ceiling pin → standard-gated follow-on PRs, the 2026-07-06 ci-tools incident class), plus the branch name, commit message, and PR title/body. The `gh pr list` dup-guard and the `changelog_conflict` refusal run behind an injectable seam so `tests/test_release_train_propose.py` is fully hermetic (no network / gh / repo writes). **`--dry-run` is the default and the only mode this step exercises**: it prints the well-formed proposal and writes nothing / opens nothing. The `--execute` code path and wiring the `propose` mode into `release-train.yml` are deferred to step 2.2. `util/` is not pre-commit-lint-gated, so the new unittest is the gate, wired into `ci.yml` alongside the detector tests.
- **Release-train Phase 1.4: non-blocking Slack notification lane in `release-train.yml`.** Each report run now posts a compact summary (classification counts, packages needing release action, run URL — no secrets, no diff content) to the Juniper Slack channel via the owner-provisioned `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` incoming-webhook repo secret (Q-CHANNEL decision, plan §11). Strictly non-blocking by construction: with the secret absent the step logs a skip and the run stays green, and a Slack post failure never fails the train (`continue-on-error: true`). The step-summary table + manifest artifact remain the canonical auditable record; Slack is additive signal only.
- **Release-train Phase 1.3: daily report-only orchestrator (`.github/workflows/release-train.yml`).** Implements step 1.3 of the [PyPI release-train plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-11_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PYPI-RELEASE-TRAIN-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md): a scheduled workflow (daily `0 13 * * *` UTC per the ratified Q-CADENCE decision, plus `workflow_dispatch`) that full-history-clones the 7 sibling package repos — including `juniper-recurrence`, which the `docs-full-check.yml` clone list omits — runs the Phase 1.1/1.2 detection engine (`util/release_train/detect.py`, juniper-ml#641) over the 18-package registry, uploads the release-manifest JSON as a run artifact, and renders a per-package classification table into the step summary. Report-only by construction: no PRs, no Releases, no (Test)PyPI writes; detector exit 1 ("action needed") is a normal green outcome and only a hard source error (exit >= 2) fails the run. The repo variable `RELEASE_TRAIN_MODE` (`off`|`report`, default `report`) with a dispatch-input override is the instant rollback switch; the future `propose`/`ceremony` modes degrade to `report` with a warning until those phases land.
- Host orchestration reference docs now distinguish the startup scripts' `JUNIPER_CASCOR_*` overrides from the `get_cascor_*.bash` query helpers' legacy `CASCOR_*` overrides, and document the host-facing `8201` / worker-health `8210` port map in `docs/REFERENCE.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER_CHEATSHEET_JUNIPER-ML.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Host-stack operations docs now include source-verified prerequisites, all `util/get_cascor_*.bash` endpoints, PID-file versus systemd lifecycle behavior, common startup/shutdown troubleshooting, and navigation links from `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md`, and `docs/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md`.
- **CFG-08** (v7 roadmap §13846): new "Rate Limiting Defaults" subsection under "Ecosystem Compatibility" in `docs/REFERENCE.md`. Documents the intentional split-default — `juniper-data` ships `rate_limit_enabled=True`, while `juniper-cascor` and `juniper-canopy` ship `False` — alongside the per-service env-var override names (`JUNIPER_<SERVICE>_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` / `JUNIPER_<SERVICE>_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`). Closes the documentation gap the roadmap CFG-08 entry called out (defaults differ across services but the rationale wasn't surfaced anywhere central). The per-minute threshold is uniform at 60 req/min across all three; only the enable flag varies. Source-of-truth file:line refs included so a future reader can re-verify against the live Settings classes. Per-service AGENTS.md cross-references are a deferred follow-up if the central reference proves insufficient.

### Fixed

- **Release-train ceremony R7 archive-lane guard (`util/release_train/ceremony.py`) — a `git/refs` POST with no `ref=` field is now a `SeamViolation`.** `_assert_api_allowed` previously only rejected a *present* non-`refs/heads/*` value, so omitting `ref=` entirely passed the allowlist and deferred failure to the live GitHub API — weakening the documented archive-branch "heads only" invariant. Missing and empty `ref=` now fail closed; hermetic coverage in `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py`.
- **Release-train propose (`util/release_train/propose.py`) — a static-version package's `_version.py` dunder is now bumped in lockstep with `pyproject.toml` (the ml#701 stale-dunder class).** All five in-repo static packages also ship a `_version.py` `__version__`, which the pyproject-only bump silently falsified: the shipped wheel's metadata was right while its `__version__` lied (juniper-ci-tools 0.7.0, caught only by its own consumer gates and healed in ml#684; juniper-service-core 0.5.0, silent for five days, healed in ml#702). `build_proposal` now auto-detects a static package's `_version.py` by file presence (no new registry field that could itself drift) and appends the lockstep edit, naming the co-change in the proposal body + the S5.4 checklist; a present-but-unparseable dunder is left alone and flagged REQUIRED-manual (the AGENTS.md header precedent). A new always-on gate (`VersionDunderLockstepTest` in `tests/test_release_train_registry.py`) asserts `[project].version == __version__` for every in-repo static-with-dunder package (dynamic packages exempt — their dunder IS the source), closing the "service-core had no gate" hole; the hermetic propose tests cover the four shapes (both-bumped / no-phantom-edit / dynamic-unchanged / unparseable-REQUIRED-manual). Design of record: `notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-23_JUNIPER-ML_RELEASE-TRAIN-VERSION-DUNDER-LOCKSTEP-FOLLOWUP.md`.
- **Release-train ceremony (`util/release_train/ceremony.py`) — the publish-run monitor now reaches the designed terminal state instead of a premature `IN_PROGRESS`.** It polls the triggered run on a bounded wall clock (new `--monitor-timeout`, default ~15 min, at a short fixed interval) until the run is terminal (success/failure — existing handling) or parked at the owner-gated `pypi` deployment environment — GitHub reports that as run status `waiting` (a documented workflow-run status that `gh run view --json status` passes through verbatim), which the train reports as `PENDING_PYPI_APPROVAL` (plan §12-3.2, terminal-healthy) and exits 0. Only a genuine still-building timeout now yields `IN_PROGRESS` (honest, and the ceremony is idempotent so a re-run resumes at the monitor). No new `gh` surface: the fix stays within the R7 §9.3 read-only allowlist (`run list` / `run view`). Hermetic coverage in `tests/test_release_train_ceremony.py` (monitor → `PENDING_PYPI_APPROVAL` on a `waiting` fixture; honest `IN_PROGRESS` on timeout). (The same 2026-07-19 run's *other* rough edge — capturing/restoring the operator's checkout branch across the archive-PR git ops — is **superseded before release** by the signed-archive-commit change under `### Changed`: the archive lane no longer switches the checkout, so there is nothing to restore.)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **Extras floor-bump to today's ecosystem release wave.**
  `[clients]`, `[worker]`, and `[servers]` now require the versions that
  shipped to PyPI on 2026-05-23 alongside the broader
  `juniper-cascor` 0.5.0 / `juniper-canopy` 0.5.0 /
  `juniper-cascor-worker` 0.4.0 / `juniper-cascor-client` 0.4.0 /
  `juniper-data-client` 0.4.1 release wave. Specifically:
  - `[clients]`: `juniper-data-client>=0.4.0` → `>=0.4.1`;
    `juniper-cascor-client>=0.3.0` → `>=0.4.0`.
  - `[worker]`: `juniper-cascor-worker>=0.3.0` → `>=0.4.0`.
  - `[servers]`: `juniper-canopy>=0.3.0` → `>=0.5.0`;
    `juniper-cascor>=0.3.17` → `>=0.5.0`; `juniper-data>=0.6.0` (unchanged).
  - `[tools]` and `[doc-tools]` unchanged at this release. The matching
    lint contract in `tests/test_pyproject_extras.py` updates in lockstep.
  Resolved doc surfaces brought into agreement: `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `docs/REFERENCE.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md`,
  and `docs/QUICK_START.md` all now declare the same pin set.
  Drive-by fix: the `juniper-config-tools` member of `[tools]` (added
  via CFG-06 / juniper-ml#320) is now visible in the README, AGENTS.md,
  REFERENCE.md, and QUICK_START.md tables, closing pre-existing doc
  drift between pyproject and human-readable extras references.
  Version bumped 0.5.0 → 0.6.0 (semver minor: existing callers pinning
  to `juniper-ml>=0.5.0` will be transparently upgraded to the new
  floor minimums).

- **TestPyPI extras-resolution verification extended to `[tools]`.**
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` now runs a third `pip install` step
  after the bare-package install and the `[clients]` install: it also
  installs `juniper-ml[tools]==${VERSION}` from TestPyPI and imports
  the three `[tools]` packages (`juniper-ci-tools`,
  `juniper-doc-tools`, `juniper-observability`). Both light extras
  (`[clients]` + `[tools]`) are now exercised at publish time, closing
  the gap documented in the v0.5.0 release runbook §7 (which
  previously called out `[tools]` as caught only by the schema lint,
  not at publish time). `[servers]` and `[worker]` remain
  schema-lint-only because their dependency trees are too heavy to
  resolve in every release run. Matching runbook §7 update so the
  documented behavior matches reality.

- **`juniper-ml[all]` install-size advisory corrected** in
  `docs/QUICK_START.md`, `notes/releases/RELEASE_WALKTHROUGH_juniper-ml-v0.5.0_2026-05-21.md`,
  and `notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-21_JUNIPER-ML_META-PACKAGE-EXTRAS-REQUIREMENTS.md`. The
  original v0.5.0 estimate of "roughly 2 GB" understated the resolved
  on-disk footprint by ~2.5x: the actual figure measured against PyPI
  on 2026-05-21 (Python 3.13, Linux x86_64) was **5 GB on disk after
  install**. The advisory also now gives concrete per-extra footprints
  (`[clients]`, `[tools]`, `[doc-tools]` < 50 MB each; `[servers]`
  < 200 MB). Pure documentation correction; no code or pin changes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **TestPyPI extras-resolution verification step** in
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. After the bare-package install
  verification, the workflow now also installs `juniper-ml[clients]`
  from TestPyPI and imports both client modules. This exercises the
  full `[project.optional-dependencies]` resolution path against the
  published metadata, so a broken extras declaration (mistyped name,
  missing roll-up into `[all]`, dangling self-reference) fails the
  publish rather than landing on PyPI silently. `[clients]` is chosen
  because it is the lightest extra (no torch) and still walks the full
  resolver path.

- **`notes/releases/RELEASE_WALKTHROUGH_juniper-ml-v0.5.0_2026-05-21.md`**
  -- runbook for the v0.5.0 release. Documents preconditions, the
  TestPyPI / PyPI flow, the new extras-resolution verification step,
  and the rollback options (yank vs. patch release) for a meta-package
  whose extras surface has expanded.

- **`tests/test_agents_md_version_drift.py`** -- new lint test pinning
  `AGENTS.md`'s `**Version**:` header to `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[project].version`. juniper-ml#295 bumped `pyproject.toml` from
  0.4.1 to 0.5.0 but left `AGENTS.md` at 0.4.0 for ~6 days (drift
  caught by ad-hoc grep + fixed in juniper-ml#304); this lint makes
  the failure class impossible to ship. Wired into the main CI tests
  job; intentionally portable (auto-locates the repo root) so the
  same module can be dropped into any Juniper repo's `tests/` to
  catch the same drift class there.

- **`notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-21_JUNIPER-ML_META-PACKAGE-EXTRAS-REQUIREMENTS.md`** -- source
  requirements doc for the meta-package extras surface. Specifies the
  declared groups, `[all]` aggregate semantics, version-bump policy,
  documentation-consistency surfaces, regression-coverage expectations,
  and the install-size advisory. Written in the source-doc format that
  the next snapshot consolidation pass can ingest; `JR-ML-*` IDs will
  be assigned at that pass and referenced retroactively in PRs #293,
  #295, #299.

- **Install-size advisory for `juniper-ml[all]`** in `docs/QUICK_START.md`.
  Calls out that `[all]` transitively pulls a multi-GB dependency tree
  (notably `torch` via `juniper-cascor-worker` and `juniper-cascor`,
  approx. 2 GB on a fresh env) and recommends narrower extras
  (`[clients]`, `[tools]`, `[doc-tools]`) when the worker / server
  distributions are not needed.

- **`tests/test_pyproject_extras.py`** -- new lint test pinning the
  `[project.optional-dependencies]` surface so accidental edits (drop,
  mistype, fail to roll up into `[all]`) fail loudly in CI. Schema-strict:
  any future change to extras must update the lint contract in the same
  PR. Wired into the main CI tests job; runs alongside
  `test_doc_tools_drift.py` and `test_workflow_script_paths.py`.

- **`[servers]` optional dependency group** for the three Juniper service
  packages on PyPI. `pip install juniper-ml[servers]` now installs
  `juniper-canopy>=0.3.0`, `juniper-cascor>=0.3.17`, and
  `juniper-data>=0.6.0` in a single step. Previously the meta-package
  only aggregated the client/worker libraries; the server distributions
  had to be installed by name.

- **`[tools]` optional dependency group** that aggregates the three
  PyPI-published Juniper tool packages: `juniper-ci-tools>=0.1.0`
  (dependency-documentation generator, Wave 1 of the dep-docs migration
  plan), `juniper-doc-tools>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` (markdown link validator),
  and `juniper-observability>=0.2.0` (shared Prometheus collector
  helpers + structured logging + Starlette middleware). The
  pre-existing `[doc-tools]` extra is retained for back-compat with
  callers that already installed via that name.

- **`[all]` extra expanded** to cover the new `[servers]` and `[tools]`
  groups in addition to `[clients]` and `[worker]`. A single
  `pip install juniper-ml[all]` now pulls in every published Juniper
  package: 3 servers, 2 clients, 1 worker, and 3 tools.

### Changed

- **Pre-tag docs polish for the 0.5.0 release.** Refreshes the three
  Ecosystem Compatibility tables (`README.md`, `docs/REFERENCE.md`,
  `docs/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md`) to enumerate every package the
  meta-package now pins -- canopy / cascor / data / data-client /
  cascor-client / cascor-worker / ci-tools / doc-tools / observability
  -- with their actual pyproject pins (the previous tables only listed
  3-5 packages and used stale `0.4.x` headers). Adds `[servers]`,
  `[tools]`, and `[doc-tools]` editable-install commands to `AGENTS.md`
  and `docs/DEVELOPER_CHEATSHEET_JUNIPER-ML.md`, plus an explicit
  multi-GB callout on `[all]`.

- **Version bumped to 0.5.0** (semver minor) to mark the new optional
  dependency surface. No removals or breaking changes -- existing
  `[clients]`, `[worker]`, `[doc-tools]`, and `[all]` install commands
  continue to work; `[all]` is now a strict superset.
- **`juniper-observability` is now aggregated under `juniper-ml[tools]`
  and `juniper-ml[all]`.** Until 0.4.1 it was published from this
  repository as a sibling package that had to be installed directly.
  Documentation in `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md`,
  `docs/REFERENCE.md`, and `docs/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md` updated to
  reflect this. Independent versioning and the
  `juniper-observability-v*` tag pipeline are unchanged.

- **§5 drift-detection guard rails** for the `juniper-doc-tools` PyPI
  migration (plan
  [`notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-18_JUNIPER-ML_DOC-TOOLS-PYPI-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`](notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-18_JUNIPER-ML_DOC-TOOLS-PYPI-MIGRATION-PLAN.md)
  §5.1 + §5.2). Closes the open follow-ups from Wave 4.
  - `tests/test_doc_tools_drift.py` — consumer-version-pin lint. Reads
    the current `juniper-doc-tools` version from
    `juniper-doc-tools/pyproject.toml`, then walks each cloned consumer
    repo's `ci.yml` and asserts the `juniper-doc-tools>=X,<Y` pin still
    admits current. Soft-warns when a pin lags by more than 2 minors;
    hard-fails when the upper bound excludes current. Also lints
    juniper-ml's own `ci.yml` + `docs-full-check.yml` for the same pin
    rule (this case runs even per-PR; the cross-repo assertion auto-
    skips when siblings aren't on disk). Local runs skip the cross-repo
    assertion by default to avoid stale-working-tree false positives;
    set `JUNIPER_DRIFT_TEST_FORCE_LOCAL=1` to override.
  - `.github/workflows/docs-full-check.yml` — two new steps in the
    weekly cross-repo workflow:
    - "Lint doc-tools pins across consumer repos" invokes the new test.
    - "Downstream-consumer integration check" installs `juniper-doc-tools`,
      runs `juniper-check-doc-links` against each cloned consumer repo's
      docs with the canonical Juniper exclude set, and aggregates per-
      repo results. Per-repo failures are warned; the step fails only
      when `>=DOWNSTREAM_FAIL_THRESHOLD` consumers regress in the same
      week (default 5 of 6 = catastrophic juniper-doc-tools regression).

### Removed

- **`util/check_doc_links.py`** (the inline v0.7.0 validator) — Wave 2 + Wave 4 of the doc-link migration plan. Replaced by the PyPI-published `juniper-doc-tools` package; install with `pip install juniper-doc-tools` and invoke via `juniper-check-doc-links`. The CI docs jobs (`ci.yml`, `docs-full-check.yml`) now install the package and run the console script. Inline copies in all 7 sibling repos (canopy / cascor / data / cascor-client / cascor-worker / data-client / ml) are deleted in the same wave.
- `scripts/check_doc_links.py` (symlink to the old `util/` copy), `util/check_doc_links.bash` (local-path-only convenience wrapper), and `tests/test_check_doc_links.py` (now covered by `juniper-doc-tools/tests/`).

### Added

- `util/check_doc_links.py` bumped to **v0.7.0**: classifies ecosystem-root paths (`../../CLAUDE.md`, `../../AGENTS.md`, `../../notes/`, `../../prompts/`, `../../resources/`, `../../backups/`, `../../logs/`, `../../worktrees/`, `../../juniper-legacy/`, `../../Juniper{,1}.code-workspace`) the same way as cross-repo `../juniper-X/` links: subject to the `--cross-repo` policy (skip/warn/check). Restores parity with the more permissive behavior repo docs were already relying on without silently accepting truly broken outside-repo links. 5 new regression tests in `tests/test_check_doc_links.py` cover the ecosystem-root paths and a guard against misclassifying intra-repo links that happen to traverse a `notes/`-named directory.
- `tests/test_workflow_script_paths.py` — new lint test that walks `.github/workflows/*.yml`, extracts every script path referenced via `python|bash <path>` / `python3 -m unittest ... <path.py>` / `$VAR <path>` patterns, and asserts each path exists in the repo. Cross-repo paths (`juniper-X/...`) are skipped as runtime-resolved. Catches the failure class that broke 3 juniper-X CIs on 2026-05-18 when a script was renamed without updating the workflow. Designed to be copy-and-paste portable into the other Juniper repos' `tests/` directories.
- **`juniper-doc-tools` subpackage scaffold** — Wave 0 of the doc-link
  validator PyPI migration ([plan](notes/JUNIPER_2026-05-18_JUNIPER-ML_DOC-TOOLS-PYPI-MIGRATION-PLAN.md)).
  New `juniper-doc-tools/` subdirectory packages the v0.7.0 markdown link
  validator as a PyPI distribution with a stable CLI surface
  (`juniper-check-doc-links` + `python -m juniper_doc_tools`), a small
  library API (`validate_directory`, `validate_file`, `ValidationResult`),
  and the new `--strict-repo-boundary` opt-out flag from §3.4.1 / §8.4.
  Tests use pytest (§8.1); 30 tests cover the v0.7.0 behavior, the new
  flag, and CLI argparse end-to-end. `.github/workflows/ci-doc-tools.yml`
  runs the test matrix (3.12/3.13/3.14) + build + wheel smoke-test on
  PRs touching `juniper-doc-tools/**`. `.github/workflows/publish-doc-tools.yml`
  publishes to TestPyPI → PyPI on tags matching `juniper-doc-tools-v*`,
  mirroring the existing `publish-observability.yml`.
- **`juniper-doc-tools` 0.1.0 published to PyPI** — Wave 1 of the
  migration plan. Tag `juniper-doc-tools-v0.1.0` cut from `main` on
  2026-05-19; OIDC trusted publish went through TestPyPI → PyPI without
  intervention (TestPyPI verified install + console-script + module-form
  on a fresh runner). `pip install juniper-doc-tools` now works from
  any environment. New `[doc-tools]` extra in this `pyproject.toml`
  pins the consumer to `>=0.1.0,<0.2.0` so a future breaking minor
  bump does not auto-adopt before Wave 2 swaps each repo's CI over.
  Next: Wave 2 (per-repo CI swap) starts in juniper-ml itself, then
  fans out to the 7 other ecosystem repos.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **`juniper-observability` package (alpha `0.1.1a`)** — new sibling package living under `juniper-observability/` (METRICS-MON R2.1.1, PR #155). Provides cross-cutting observability primitives shared by every Juniper server: health models (`DependencyStatus`, `ReadinessResponse`), the synchronous `probe_dependency` helper, structured-JSON logging (`JuniperJsonFormatter`, `configure_logging`) with `request_id` propagation, Starlette middlewares (`RequestIdMiddleware`, `PrometheusMiddleware` with bounded label cardinality per R1.1), pinned cross-service constants (`UNMATCHED_ENDPOINT_LABEL`, `READINESS_HEADER`, `LIVENESS_TICK_BUDGET_MS`, `LIVENESS_STALENESS_SECONDS`), Prometheus utilities (`get_prometheus_app`, `set_build_info`), and Sentry init (`configure_sentry`) with the SEC-10 `before_send` hook always installed. Optional extras: `[prometheus]`, `[sentry]`, `[all]`. Per-service metric definitions intentionally stay in their owning repos; this package only exposes cross-cutting infrastructure.
- `.github/workflows/ci-observability.yml` — dedicated CI pipeline for the observability package.
- `.github/workflows/publish-observability.yml` — OIDC trusted-publishing workflow for `juniper-observability` (TestPyPI → install verification → PyPI), triggered by tags matching `juniper-observability-v*` so it stays decoupled from the meta-package's own `v*` release tags. `workflow_dispatch` is enabled so operators can re-fire a publish against any tag.
- Hardcoded-values refactor (Wave 3 + Wave 4): all 6 `util/get_cascor_*.bash` REST query utilities now read `CASCOR_HOST` and `CASCOR_PORT` from the environment (defaulting to `localhost` / `8201`) so a single environment override targets every utility instead of editing each script individually.
- `util/juniper_plant_all.bash` `JUNIPER_CASCOR_HOST` is now an env-var override (`JUNIPER_CASCOR_HOST=${JUNIPER_CASCOR_HOST:-localhost}`) — useful for orchestrating remote services from a control host.
- New regression test suite `tests/test_worktree_cleanup.py` covering argument parsing, dry-run output, error handling, and the critical safety property that the new worktree is created before the old one is removed (CWD-trap prevention).
- Metrics-monitoring roadmap and design notes under `notes/code-review/` covering R1.1–R1.3 contracts and the R2.1 shared-observability migration sequence; ongoing Track 1–6 status sweeps marking shipped/blocked/open work across the ecosystem.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/publish-observability.yml` — `verbose: true` enabled on both the TestPyPI and PyPI `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` steps so upload failures surface the underlying response body instead of twine's bare `Bad Request` line.
- Hardcoded-values refactor (Wave 3): `util/worktree_cleanup.bash` `MAIN_REPO` is now derived from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` (one directory up from the script) instead of being hardcoded to `/home/pcalnon/Development/python/Juniper/juniper-ml`. An optional `JUNIPER_ML_MAIN_REPO` environment variable overrides the derived path for test fixtures and unusual layouts. This makes the script portable across machines and CI runners.
- Test timeout constants extracted in `tests/test_wake_the_claude.py` and `tests/test_worktree_cleanup.py` (`SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) instead of inline `subprocess.run(..., timeout=30)` calls.
- AGENTS.md "Utilities" section updated to document the new env-var overrides for `worktree_cleanup.bash`, `juniper_plant_all.bash`, and the `get_cascor_*.bash` utilities.

### Notes

- All 88 unittest tests pass plus the bash `test_resume_file_safety.bash` regression script; pre-commit (17 hooks: flake8, bandit, shellcheck, markdownlint, yamllint, sops-check) is clean.
- This branch is on `feature/hardcoded-values-wave3` rather than `wave1` because juniper-ml had no Wave 1 task in the master roadmap (the meta-package owns no application code that needed a constants module).
- `juniper-observability` is not yet wired into the `juniper-ml[all]` extras. It will be added once the alpha graduates and downstream services start importing from it as part of the R2.1 migration.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

**Summary**: Microservices orchestration layer (`juniper_plant_all.bash` / `juniper_chop_all.bash`), full systemd integration, V2 worktree cleanup orchestrator with CWD-safe session continuity, CasCor REST API query utilities, the `claudey` interactive launcher, and ecosystem version convergence — extras bumped to track the latest released `juniper-data-client`, `juniper-cascor-client`, and `juniper-cascor-worker`. Also incorporates the cross-project release-prep code review and remediation plan.

See [`notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md`](notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md) for the full release notes.

### Changed

  - `juniper-data-client` from `>=0.3.0` to `>=0.4.0` (adds batch operations and dataset versioning)
  - `juniper-cascor-client` from `>=0.1.0` to `>=0.3.0` (adds worker/snapshot/dataset methods, testing module)
  - `juniper-cascor-worker` from `>=0.1.0` to `>=0.3.0` (WebSocket-based agent, TLS support, deprecates legacy mode)

### Added

- `util/juniper_plant_all.bash` -- Microservices startup script with health checks, conda environment activation, and PID file management
- `util/juniper_chop_all.bash` -- Microservices shutdown script with graceful SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation, PID file parsing, and orphaned worker cleanup
- Systemd integration (`--systemd` mode) for both startup and shutdown scripts, including `juniper-all-ctl` management script and `juniper-all.target` unit
- Cascor-worker integration into systemd target and startup/shutdown scripts (Phase 3)
- `util/worktree_cleanup.bash` -- V2 automated worktree cleanup orchestrator with CWD-safe session continuity
- `tests/test_worktree_cleanup.py` -- Regression tests for worktree cleanup argument parsing, dry-run, and error handling
- `util/worktree_new.bash`, `util/worktree_activate.bash`, `util/worktree_close.bash`, `util/worktree_wipeout.bash` -- Worktree management utilities
- `util/get_cascor_status.bash`, `util/get_cascor_metrics.bash`, `util/get_cascor_history.bash`, `util/get_cascor_network.bash`, `util/get_cascor_topology.bash` -- CasCor REST API query utilities
- `scripts/claude_interactive.bash` -- Interactive Claude Code agent launcher (`claudey` symlink at repo root)
- Cross-project regression analysis, remediation plans, and development roadmaps in `notes/`

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` updated to v0.4.0 with comprehensive structure documentation, CI/CD pipeline details, and worktree/handoff procedures
- Dependabot CI action version bumps: `anthropics/claude-code-action` (1.0.62 -> 1.0.89), `actions/cache` (4.2.3 -> 5.0.4), `actions/upload-artifact` (6.0.0 -> 7.0.0), `actions/download-artifact` (8.0.0 -> 8.0.1)
- Moved worktree management and documentation utilities from `scripts/` to `util/`

### Fixed

- CI `dependency-docs` job path corrected from `scripts/generate_dep_docs.sh` to `util/generate_dep_docs.sh`
- PID file parsing in `juniper_chop_all.bash` replaced `read -d ''` (whitespace splitting) with `mapfile -t` (line-oriented) to handle multi-word PID file lines correctly
- Removed contradictory `done < PID_FILE` redirect from for-loop that iterated over an already-populated array
- `juniper_chop_all.bash` `KILL_WORKERS` default changed from hardcoded `"1"` to `"0"` to match documented behavior
- `juniper_chop_all.bash` `SIGTERM_TIMEOUT` default changed from hardcoded `"10"` to environment-variable-driven `"15"` to match documented behavior
- Worker search term narrowed from `"cascor"` to `"juniper-cascor-worker"` to prevent false-positive matches against the cascor backend
- Added `test_worktree_cleanup.py` to CI pipeline test execution
- PID reference fixes in startup scripts (`juniper_plant_all.bash`)
- Test script paths updated after `scripts/` to `util/` migration

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- `scripts/activate_conda_env.bash` — Bash helper for conda environment activation/deactivation with structured sections for compilation workflows
- `scripts/cleanup_open_worktrees.bash` — Automates git worktree cleanup by iterating through worktrees and performing status/add/pull/push operations
- `scripts/prune_git_branches_without_working_dirs.bash` — Prunes local git branches that lack corresponding working directories; supports standard and forced deletion modes
- `scripts/remove_stale_worktrees.bash` — Iterates through and removes stale git worktrees
- `scripts/test_resume_file_safety.bash` — Focused regression script that verifies invalid `--resume <file.txt>` input returns non-zero and preserves the source file
- `notes/stack_overflow_answer.txt` — Reference material on managing conda environments programmatically in bash scripts
- `notes/pull_requests/JUNIPER_2026-03-15_JUNIPER-ML_PR-TOOLING-MORE-CLAUDE-UTILS.md` — PR description archive
- `notes/DEVELOPER_CHEATSHEET.md` — Added session ID workflow documentation, `wake_the_claude.bash` quick runbook, regression-test commands, `--resume` alias handling, interactive-vs-headless launch behavior, and troubleshooting sections
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md` — Added navigation links for Claude session tooling runbooks
- New test coverage in `tests/test_wake_the_claude.py` for default launcher argument forwarding, permissions handling, and prompt token validation

### Changed

- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Uncommented `EFFORT_VALUE` and `MODEL_VALUE` assignments; refactored nohup logging to handle missing log files; changed debug output to standard echo; consolidated exit status checks
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Standardized comment spacing for action version tags (dependabot version bumps)
- `notes/JUNIPER_2026-03-15_JUNIPER-ML_CONDA-DEPENDENCY-FILE-HEADER.md` — Renamed back from `.yaml` to `.md` (matching all other repos' naming convention)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Added version identifiers to section headers for released versions
- Documentation formatting pass across `notes/` planning documents — standardized Markdown table alignment, added `bash` language tags to code blocks, converted URLs to Markdown link syntax

### Fixed

- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Replaced `eval`-based flag matching in `matches_pattern()` with split-and-compare logic
- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Moved `debug_log` and `redact_uuid` definitions before top-level calls to prevent `command not found` stderr noise
- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Hardened `--id` (without value) session generation to validate UUIDs across multiple fallback sources when `uuidgen` is unavailable

### Security

- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Removed a latent command-injection vector by eliminating `eval` from pattern matching

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added, 0.2.1

- `scripts/wake_the_claude.bash` — Shell script to launch Claude Code sessions with configurable flags, session persistence, and resume support
- `notes/SESSION_ID_VALIDATION_BUGFIX_PLAN.md` — Root cause analysis and fix plan
- `notes/SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` — Security vulnerability analysis and remediation plan
- `notes/pull_requests/JUNIPER_2026-03-06_JUNIPER-ML_PR-SESSION-ID-VALIDATION-BUGFIX.md` — PR description archive
- `notes/templates/TEMPLATE_PULL_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION.md` — PR description template (adopted from sibling repos)

### Fixed, 0.2.1

- **Session ID validation**: Redirected diagnostic `echo` statements to stderr (`>&2`) in `is_valid_uuid`, `retrieve_session_id`, and `validate_session_id`, reserving stdout exclusively for return values captured via `$(...)`
- **Subshell exit status**: Moved `RETURN_VALUE=$?` to a separate line after command substitution so the exit status propagates to the parent scope
- **Double usage print**: Replaced `usage`/`exit` calls with `return` inside `validate_session_id`, since `exit` inside `$(...)` only terminates the subshell
- **Ambiguous log message**: Added `session_id_filename` local variable to preserve the original filename for the "from file" log message

### Security, 0.2.1

- **Path traversal in `--resume`** (High): Reject filenames containing path separators (`/`) or lacking `.txt` extension; removed destructive `rm -f` from `retrieve_session_id`; suppressed raw file content in error logs
- **Arbitrary file write in `save_session_id`** (High): Added UUID format validation before any filesystem write; applied `basename` defense-in-depth; scoped `session_id` as `local`
- **Argument injection via `CLAUDE_CODE_PARAMS`** (Medium): Converted from flat string to bash array; execute with `"${CLAUDE_CODE_PARAMS[@]}"` to prevent word-splitting injection
