# Description:
#   Read-only dataset attribution for a cascor snapshot archive (handoff 2026-08-22 §3.2).
#   Scores each loadable snapshot against every shape-compatible cascor dataset and reports
#   which one it was plausibly trained on -- gated against an untrained-network null, because
#   "beats chance" is NOT evidence here. Writes only a derived sidecar; never touches a .h5.

"""Infer which dataset a snapshot was trained on, or honestly say we cannot tell.

Usage:
    python util/snapshot_attribute.py --null-only            # show the per-dataset floors
    python util/snapshot_attribute.py --sample 200 --stats   # cost/behaviour probe
    python util/snapshot_attribute.py --write --stats        # full pass, persist the sidecar
    python util/snapshot_attribute.py --from-sidecar --verdict attributed

THE OWNER'S DESIGN, AND THE TWO CORRECTIONS MEASUREMENT FORCED ON IT
    §3.2: "since inference is computationally cheap, network accuracy per dataset can be
    calculated for all cascor, 2-in -> 2-out datasets. getting a better than random accuracy
    for a dataset is a strong--but not definitive--indicator that the network trained on that
    dataset [...] select the dataset associated with the largest increase in accuracy over
    chance."

    The shape of that is right and it is what this implements. Two things had to change, both
    because an experiment said so rather than because they read better:

    1. RAW ACCURACY IS THE WRONG MEASURE. One-hot column order is an arbitrary convention of
       whichever generator run produced the training data, so a network that learned a dataset
       with its columns swapped scores ``1 - p`` -- reading as far BELOW chance, i.e. as "did
       not learn this", which is exactly backwards. Measured: archive snapshots scoring
       **0.010 / 0.030** on gaussian are 0.990 / 0.970 with the labels inverted. Correcting to
       a permutation-invariant score moved decisive picks from 6/14 to 12/14 and changed most
       winners.

    2. "BETTER THAN CHANCE" IS NOT THE RIGHT BAR -- AN UNTRAINED NETWORK ALREADY CLEARS IT.
       A freshly-initialised, never-trained network beats chance on ``gaussian`` by **+0.408
       on average, up to +0.500 (perfect)**, because gaussian blobs are linearly separable and
       a random linear boundary separates them. 11 of 12 untrained networks "pick" gaussian.
       Permutation-correction makes this worse, not better.

       So the bar is not chance, it is **the untrained-network null for that dataset**. This
       module builds that null and refuses to attribute below it.

WHY THIS IS NOT OVER-CAUTION
    Applied to the archive's best-grown snapshots, the null is what separates a real answer
    from a confident wrong one:

        network 295a396f  (18 -> 103 hidden units)  xor 0.945 -> 0.995, floor 0.690  ATTRIBUTED
        network 17de4973  (125 -> 256 hidden)       gaussian 0.970-0.990, floor 1.000  REJECTED
        network 4e96c5b7  (35 -> 38 hidden)         moon 0.830-0.865,     floor 0.885  REJECTED

    The 17de4973 family has up to 256 hidden units and enormous gaussian margins. Without the
    null it would be confidently attributed to gaussian; with it, it is correctly indeterminate.

    ``gaussian`` is effectively unattributable for this reason -- its floor is 1.000, so no
    score can distinguish a trained network from a random one. It is scored and reported, but
    it can never be an ANSWER.

    3. THE FLOOR IS THE NULL'S OBSERVED MAXIMUM, NOT ITS p95. A zero-hidden-unit network is a
       linear model and cannot learn a non-linearly-separable problem, yet such networks scored
       ~0.624 on checkerboard -- above its untrained p95 (0.565) but below its observed max
       (0.610), i.e. inside the null's uncharacterised tail. Under a p95 floor they attribute;
       under a max floor they do not, while the xor cluster (+0.235 median lift) is untouched.
       (An earlier revision of this passage put a specific count on that cohort. It is not
       reproducible from the current sidecar -- checkerboard now has ZERO attributions -- and
       it contradicted itself on where the scores sat. The mechanism is what the tests pin.)

    4. THE UNTRAINED NULL ANSWERS THE WRONG QUESTION, SO THERE IS A SECOND FLOOR. See
       ``build_cross_dataset_floor``. The untrained null can only ask "did this network learn
       ANYTHING?"; attribution needs "did it learn THIS rather than something else?". A
       snapshot attributed to spiral (7 hidden units) scored gaussian 0.890, moon 0.835 and
       spiral 0.624 -- attributed to spiral while scoring worse on spiral than on three other
       datasets, purely because spiral's untrained floor was the lowest available. A candidate
       must now clear BOTH floors. ``--no-cross-dataset-floor`` restores the older behaviour.

WHAT MEASUREMENT SAID ABOUT CAPACITY -- AND WHY A CAPACITY-MATCHED NULL IS NOT THE FIX
    This module used to carry a KNOWN LIMITATION saying the null is built from ZERO-hidden-unit
    networks and is therefore "too lenient for grown networks", with a capacity-matched null
    named as the rigorous fix. That was measured, and **it does not hold**.

    Of the 129 attributions, **none** had zero hidden units (they run 1..103), so the concern
    applied to all of them -- yet rebuilding the null at matched capacity withdrew only 3. At
    high capacity the capacity-matched floor is frequently LOWER than the zero-unit one: a
    zero-unit network is a linear model and a good linear split already scores well after
    permutation correction, whereas ~100 cascade units with RANDOM weights inject noise columns
    into the readout and push the score toward chance. A high score at high capacity is
    therefore HARDER to reach by accident, not easier.

    What the archive actually needed was not a capacity-matched null but a differently-TRAINED
    one -- item 4 above. Full measurement, including the weight-permutation null and the
    per-dataset outcome (xor holds with zero distributional overlap; spiral withdrawn; moon
    undecidable on one contested snapshot), is in
    ``notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-24_JUNIPER-CASCOR_ATTRIBUTION-NULL-MODEL-FINDINGS.md``.

VALIDATED BY A POSITIVE CONTROL
    Networks trained here on a known dataset and then attributed: **4/4 correct** (xor,
    gaussian, circles, moon; spiral and checkerboard were excluded because training did not
    take at the control's budget -- 8 hidden units still scored 0.510 on spiral). The method
    works when the network actually learned; it is the archive that is mostly under-trained,
    median 3 hidden units.

    5. THE DATASET INSTANCE HAS TO BE PINNED, OR NOTHING HERE IS REPRODUCIBLE. Five of the six
       generators declare ``seed: int | None = Field(default=None)``, so building them from
       their bare defaults draws DIFFERENT data on every call -- measured: two ``load_datasets``
       calls in ONE process returned different arrays for checkerboard, circles, gaussian, moon
       and xor. ``spiral`` alone declares a real default seed, and it was the only generator
       whose counts held steady across a rebuild.

       The cost was not theoretical. Regenerating the archive sidecar moved moon's attributed
       count from 0 to 6: moon's own score shifted 1.000 -> 0.995, which flipped one snapshot's
       first-pass winner, which removed it from moon's reference class, which dropped moon's
       cross floor 1.000 -> 0.850. ``seeded_params`` now supplies ``DATASET_SEED`` to any
       generator declaring none, and leaves a declared seed alone so spiral keeps the exact
       instance every prior analysis used. That instance is generator 1.x's: since decision 11
       every generator is at 3.0.0 or later and each one's rows changed (V-1), so a rebuild now
       scores a different instance and does not reproduce the 2026-08-24 counts (juniper-ml#2034).

WHAT A VERDICT MEANS
    attributed    -- one dataset clears its null floor and is separated from the runner-up.
                     Strong, NOT definitive: it means "this network behaves like one trained
                     on X", which is evidence, not provenance.
    indeterminate -- nothing clears its floor. The expected answer for most of the archive,
                     and an honest one: under-trained networks carry no signature.
    ambiguous     -- something clears its floor but the runner-up is too close to separate.

NO --prune. Retention is design §6.4 and is gated on evidence like this, not performed by it.
