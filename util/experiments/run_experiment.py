Plan of record: ``notes/JUNIPER_2026-07-29_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_CASCOR-RECURRENCE-CLI-TEST-VALIDATION-EXPERIMENTATION-PLAN.md``
(SS6.3 driver responsibilities, SS6.4 RUN_DIR layout, SS13.4 run manifest, SS10.6 test contract) plus the Wave-0
preflight evidence doc (finding F-1 binds the ``/metrics`` sampling to redirect-following GETs).

WHAT IT DOES (SS6.3, in order):

  1. loads + validates the experiment YAML (SS5.6 driver-enforced subset: unknown blocks/keys,
     ``schema_version``, the mandatory ``experiment.seed``, and the rule-6 infra-key rejection);
     resolves the app kind from the config shape (``training:`` => cascor, ``train:`` => recurrence);
  2. health-waits on the run's juniper-data and cascor services (bounded);
  3. pre-flights the dataset: ``GET /v1/generators`` must list ``dataset.generator`` with ``available: true``;
  4. drives the run: ``POST /v1/datasets`` on juniper-data (recording the content-addressed ``dataset_id``),
     then stages EVERY generator via ``POST /v1/training/dataset`` (G-6) and asserts the loaded shape
     afterwards -- spiral included since F-P4-1: the inline ``dataset`` source materialized cascor's
     in-process fallback (unit-radius, params ignored) instead of the configured juniper-data dataset,
     so every service spiral run terminated below_threshold with zero hidden units at chance accuracy;
     polls ``GET /v1/training/status`` to ``COMPLETED`` / ``FAILED`` under the Q-2 wall-clock
     budget (``outputs.max_wall_seconds``, default 3600) and stall detector (no ``current_epoch`` change for
     ``--stall-seconds``, default 120 -> ``outcome: "stalled"``, never a silent hang); on every poll samples
     the app's own loopback ``/metrics`` exposition (redirect-following, F-1) and appends the allowlisted
     family subset to ``artifacts/results/metrics_series.csv`` -- ``juniper_cascor_candidate_correlation``
     exists ONLY there (``/v1/metrics/history`` rows carry no correlation field);
  5. collects results into ``artifacts/results/``: ``metrics_final.json``, ``metrics_history.json``,
     ``topology.json``, ``decision_boundary.npz`` (2-D input only), and optionally ``POST /v1/snapshots``;
  6. writes the SS13.4 ``manifest.json`` (always -- also for stalled / timed-out / failed runs, so every
     run leaves evidence) and prints a one-screen summary.

Exit codes (SS6.3 item 8):
  0  success (run COMPLETED and the acceptance checks passed)
  1  run did not meet acceptance criteria (stalled, timed_out, interrupted, G-6 shape mismatch,
     or an essential artifact could not be collected)
  2  misuse / validation error (bad CLI, bad YAML, unknown/unavailable generator, 422 from the API)
  3  service unreachable (health-wait timeout or repeated connection failures)
  4  run reached FAILED / a 5xx from a service

The recurrence path (Wave 2.3, SS6.3 step 4 *recurrence* + SS5.5): ``POST /v1/train`` is
**synchronous** -- the response IS completion (``routers/training.py:37``), so there is no poll loop;
the Q-2 wall-clock budget is enforced as the request's socket timeout (a timeout -> ``timed_out``,
exit 1, distinct from connection failure). Health gate is ``/v1/health/ready``. The driver creates the
dataset on the run's juniper-data first (content-addressed ``dataset_id`` for the SS13.4 manifest) and
drives every phase by ``dataset_id`` ref (H-8: never a bare name). Optional ``POST /v1/predict``
(re-refs the dataset with ``predict.from_dataset_split``, default ``test``) and ``POST /v1/crossval``
(same LMU hyperparameters as the train block, so bench comparability holds -- SS10.4) follow; a
predict/crossval failure is recorded and the run continues to the manifest (acceptance failure,
exit 1) rather than dying mid-evidence. ``outputs.save_model: true`` (G-18: service mode leaves no
model artifact) re-runs the ``juniper-recurrence train`` CLI with ``--dataset <dataset_id>`` + the
identical hyperparameter flags + ``--out .../model.npz`` as an explicit, manifest-recorded extra step
-- the CLI has no ``--params`` flag (``main.py``), so the ``dataset_id`` ref is the only faithful form.

Plots (Wave 2.4, SS8.1): when ``outputs.plots`` requests them, the cascor path renders the SS8.1 set
client-side from the collected payloads via ``plots_cascor.py`` (lazily loaded -- the driver stays
importable without matplotlib): ``dataset`` (the fetched NPZ artifact; 2-feature generators only),
``decision_boundary`` (the collected grid + sample overlay), ``training_history`` (history rows with
hidden-unit-insertion markers), ``candidate_correlation`` (from the driver's own metrics_series.csv --
the sole source), and ``eval_metrics`` (scalar bars). Structurally-unavailable data is a recorded
per-plot SKIP (exit 0); a render error / failed fetch / missing matplotlib on a requested plot is an
acceptance failure (exit 1). The recurrence set (SS8.2, Wave 2.5 -- closes G-5) renders the same way
via ``plots_recurrence.py``: ``dataset_overview`` / ``dt_histogram`` from the fetched 3-D NPZ
(``{X,y,dt,target_dt}_{split}``; ``y_reg_{split}`` preferred when present -- the equities regression
target), ``forecast_vs_truth`` / ``residuals`` from the predict response vs the predict split's
target, ``crossval_folds`` from the CrossValResponse folds, and ``metrics_table``; a disabled or
failed predict/crossval phase is a per-plot SKIP. There is deliberately no recurrence
training-history plot (TrainResponse carries no per-epoch series -- SS8.2 note).

Stats (Wave 2.6, SS8.3): every run also writes ``artifacts/results/stats.json`` + a human-readable
``summary.md`` via ``stats_summary.py`` (stdlib-only) -- identity / dataset-shape / outcome-timing
blocks from the manifest, the cascor candidate-correlation-per-round and step-duration p50/p95 stats
from the driver's own ``metrics_series.csv`` (the sole source; the duration quantiles are honestly
labeled per-poll means -- true per-step quantiles are not recoverable from a sum/count exposition),
the recurrence train/CV/theta/readout block, and the degraded-mode notes. Written for every outcome;
a stats failure is recorded on the manifest (``stats_error``), never fatal.

Wave boundaries (SS14): the ``docs/REFERENCE.md`` operator section is Wave 2.7.

Dependencies: stdlib + PyYAML; numpy is imported lazily only to write ``decision_boundary.npz`` (with a
JSON fallback when absent). HTTP is stdlib ``urllib`` rather than ``requests`` -- lighter than the SS6.3
allowance and redirect-following by default, which is exactly what F-1 requires.

``util/`` is not pre-commit-lint-gated; ``tests/test_run_experiment.py`` is the gate.

    """Flag ``max_epochs`` set without ``output_epochs`` -- they are NOT the same budget.

    The two keys mean different things on the two paths, and the difference is silent:

    * SERVICE -- ``TrainingParams.max_epochs`` is forwarded to ``fit()`` as the **initial**
      output-training pass budget only. Every later per-round pass reads
      ``self.output_epochs`` (``cascade_correlation.py:4591`` / ``:4768`` / ``:4820``), which falls
      back to ``_PROJECT_MODEL_OUTPUT_EPOCHS = 10000`` when the config leaves it unset
      (``:716``). The network source states it outright at ``:1876-1882``: *"The two therefore
      agree only while a caller leaves max_epochs unset"*.
    * DIRECT CLI -- ``_W11_TRAINING_KEY_MAP`` aliases ``max_epochs -> output_epochs``
      (``main.py:238-249``), so it bounds **every** output pass; an explicit ``output_epochs``
      wins over the alias (``main.py:291-292``).

    So a config carrying only ``max_epochs: N`` runs the CLI at N epochs per output pass and the
    service at N for the first pass and 10000 for every pass after it. On a run that grows 64-128
    units that is a several-fold per-pass asymmetry, and it makes the service arm both slower and
    better-trained than the config appears to ask for. It cost the wide-budget head-to-head
    campaign a rerun to notice (juniper-ml#1143 SS2.2).

    **CORRECTED 2026-09-02 -- smoke-scale runs DO surface it.** This docstring previously ended
    "at a 1-2 unit cap there is only the initial pass, so smoke-scale runs cannot surface it".
    That is wrong, and it is the kind of claim that stops the next reader from checking. A cap of
    N units yields the initial pass *plus one pass per added unit*, so even ``max_hidden_units: 2``
    has two non-initial passes. Measured on ``spiral-smoke.yaml`` at its NATIVE (2, 2) budget:
    ``output_epoch`` history rows reach epoch **10000** for both -- ``hidden_units=1`` maxing at
    10000, ``hidden_units=2`` spanning 1-10000. 10000 can only be the ``output_epochs`` fallback,
    because the candidate budget default is 400
    (cascor ``constants_candidates.py:130``).

    At PF-1's (10, 10) override the cost is a factor of ~125 in work:
    ``drive`` 65-126 s / ``step_count`` 4012 without the key, against 15.1 s / 32 with it
    (cascor#618, which sets both keys in ``spiral-smoke.yaml``).

    This WARNS rather than raises: a service-only run may legitimately want the split, and the
    canonical ``spiral-baseline.yaml`` ships that way. The warning is also recorded on the config
    so the manifest carries it into the run's evidence rather than living only in a log nobody
    re-reads.

    F-P4-1: every generator — spiral included — is staged via ``stage_dataset``
    before this call. The old spiral-only inline ``dataset`` source made cascor
    materialize its in-process fallback spiral (unit-radius, params silently
    ignored) instead of the configured juniper-data dataset, which pinned
    candidate correlation at ~2.7e-4 and terminated every service spiral run
    below_threshold with zero hidden units.

    A 409 gets ONE preemption attempt, and only from an active state.
    ``start_fresh: true`` does not stop a live run — the lifecycle lock is held, so
    the 409 is raised before ``start_fresh`` is ever consulted. After a driver-side
    stall/budget abort the service keeps training, and the naive re-run then dies on
    ``HTTP 409: Training already in progress`` (observed across the R-5 campaign,
    worked around with an ad-hoc attach-poller).

    The discrimination matters: ``routes/training.py:117`` wraps EVERY start failure
    as 409, including "Training data not provided". Preempting on that would paper
    over a real staging bug, so the decision is made on the lifecycle state, not the
    message text. Only ``STARTED`` / ``PAUSED`` are stoppable: ``REPLAYING`` rejects
    every training command (exit is ``/replay/control``) and ``INVESTIGATING`` needs
    ``/retrain`` or ``/resume`` — issuing a stop in either would fail and then mask
