"""Wait for a PR's REQUIRED status checks to finish, then report honestly.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: cross-repo tooling
Application: CI progress monitoring for headless sessions

Why this exists
---------------
Sessions repeatedly hand-roll a "wait for CI" loop and repeatedly get it wrong in
the same two ways. Both failure modes are silent: the loop reports success on a
suite that has not finished, and the session then merges or reports green on
incomplete evidence. This module is the reference implementation so nobody has to
rediscover the traps.

**Trap 1 -- terminal must be defined POSITIVELY.** A GitHub *check run* that is
still going carries ``conclusion: null`` and no ``state``. A loop written as "not
in my list of pending states" therefore reads an in-progress job as finished. The
list of pending states is open-ended (``QUEUED``, ``IN_PROGRESS``, ``WAITING``,
``PENDING``, ``REQUESTED``, plus whatever GitHub adds next); the list of *finished*
conclusions is closed. So this module asks "is it definitely done?" and treats
everything else as still running.

**Trap 2 -- the rollup GROWS, so "everything I can see is done" is not "the suite
is done".** Jobs are added to ``statusCheckRollup`` as they start. Between waves
(for example after the pre-commit matrix finishes but before the test matrix has
been created) every entry present is terminal and the suite looks complete. The
only stable anchor is the repo's own list of **required** contexts, read from the
branch ruleset. A required context that has not appeared yet is *not done* -- it is
absent, which is a distinct and important state.

Trap 2's absent-forever case is real and worth surfacing rather than hiding: a
``[skip ci]`` head commit produces a PR where required contexts never report at
all, the aggregate rollup can read as SUCCESS, and the PR sits permanently
unmergeable. This tool names those contexts instead of waiting mutely.

Read-only by construction: it issues only ``gh pr view`` and ``gh api ... /rules/...``
reads. It never merges, updates a branch, pushes, or comments -- so it is safe for
any session to run at any time. If it reports ``BEHIND``, the signing-safe fix is
``gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/update-branch -X PUT`` (server-side commit,
therefore GitHub-signed; a local merge + push is unsigned and ``required_signatures``
rejects it fleet-wide).

Wait budget
-----------
Omit ``--timeout`` and the CLI waits the repo's MEASURED CI budget -- ``timeout_for`` in
``util/safe_merge.py``, whose ``REPO_TIMEOUTS`` table is the only place the fleet's
required-check spans are recorded -- so a direct invocation waits exactly as long as the
merge path does. It prints that budget and its source on stderr. ``DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`` (1800 s)
applies only when that table cannot be read, and says so.

It used to be the default outright, and 1800 s sat BELOW eight of the nine measured budgets.
A healthy canopy or cascor PR could therefore exit 2 while every required context was still
legitimately running -- a timeout that reads exactly like a stuck check, which is the one
distinction those budgets exist to draw. ``safe_merge`` always passes ``--timeout``, so the
merge path never saw it; direct invocation, the way sessions are told to use this tool, did.

Usage
-----
    python util/wait_for_checks.py --pr 1130
    python util/wait_for_checks.py --pr 524 --repo juniper-cascor
    python util/wait_for_checks.py --pr 266 --repo juniper-data --json
    python util/wait_for_checks.py --pr 42 --timeout 1800 --interval 30

Exit codes
----------
0   every required context finished and none failed
1   at least one required context failed (names printed)
2   timed out -- required contexts still running or absent (names printed)
3   hard error (``gh`` failed, no ruleset, no required-status-checks rule, bad PR)

A hard error is never reported as "nothing yet". That conflation -- a failed probe
looking identical to a legitimately empty result -- is the same class as trap 1 and
is why every ``gh`` call here checks its return code.
