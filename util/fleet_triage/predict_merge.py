WHAT IT DOES (P3 §1A -- the deterministic SCRIPT layer, no agent):

For a PR branch (``--pr N``) or every open PR (``--batch``) it, per PR:

  (a) creates a throwaway DETACHED ``git clone`` under the system tempdir --
      never a ``git worktree`` of the primary repo, never the invoking checkout,
      never a push (the merge stays local and is discarded);
  (b) merges ``origin/main`` into the branch tip (``git merge --no-ff``) so the
      RESULT is the tree GitHub would actually land -- previewed here WITHOUT
      paying for it. ``strict_required_status_checks_policy`` is ``true`` on all
      nine repos, and ``allow_update_branch`` is ``false``, so a PR that has gone
      ``BEHIND`` cannot merge and GitHub will not sync it for you: every sync is a
      manual ``update-branch`` that creates a fresh head and restarts the FULL
      required-check battery (~10 min on juniper-ml). CI does eventually run on a
      main-merged tree -- after that cycle. This gives the verdict before it;
  (c) on that RESULT runs the repo-pinned fast gates on the touched files
      (``pre-commit run black isort flake8 mypy check-ast --files <changed>``)
      PLUS two screens CI cannot see, BOTH delegating to the juniper-ci-tools console
      scripts (``juniper-symbol-loss-check`` / ``juniper-docs-additions-check``, PyPI
      package >=0.8.0) on the merged RESULT so a per-PR verdict is byte-identical to the
      post-merge ``main-verify`` gate: an AST symbol-loss screen
      (a symbol present on ``origin/main`` but absent in the merged result -- the
      #755/#729/#738 "flake8+mypy still pass" damage class) and a docs
      deletion-magnitude screen (a deleted Markdown heading, or a run of >= N
      consecutive deleted lines with no adjacent addition, is a suspected #801/#803
      silent section deletion; a small in-place swap is WARN, and the same
      ``Allow-Docs-Rewrite`` commit-trailer waiver is honored so intentional rewrites
      are not DAMAGED);
  (d) emits a per-PR JSON verdict + the TRUE changed-file delta computed from the
      merge RESULT (``git diff --name-only origin/main <result>``), NOT the stale
      ``gh pr list --json files`` list (#729 showed 12 files vs 2 truly changed);
  (e) ``--batch`` builds the same-file cluster map (files -> PRs, from the true
      deltas) and a suggested merge order (heal PRs first -- a fix|heal|hotfix head
      branch or a fix(/fix:/heal title -- then ascending same-file-cluster membership
      so the least-colliding PRs land first).

Script verdicts: MERGE-CLEAN | NEEDS-UPDATE-BRANCH | DAMAGED-FIX-FIRST | CONFLICT.
The DUP-CLOSE recommendation is an agent-layer, two-key, owner-confirmed
adjudication (see ``.claude/agents/fleet-supervisor.md``); the script never
adjudicates duplicates and never closes, pushes, or merges anything.

Exit codes: 0 always-report (even when verdicts are DAMAGED/CONFLICT -- this is a
report); 2 on usage / precondition error (bad args, unresolved ref, no ``gh``,
``--repo-root`` not a git repo).

Requires: ``gh`` on PATH (PR discovery), and -- for the two compositional-loss screens --
the ``juniper-ci-tools`` package (>=0.8.0) installed so ``juniper-symbol-loss-check`` /
``juniper-docs-additions-check`` are on PATH (``pip install 'juniper-ci-tools>=0.9.0,<0.10.0'``).
If a console script is absent, that screen degrades to ``skip`` (never crashes the report);
the fast-gate battery + verdict logic still run.

Any git commit this script makes (only the throwaway local merge commit) uses
``-c commit.gpgsign=false`` so the owner's YubiKey/ed448 signing config never
blocks an unattended run.
