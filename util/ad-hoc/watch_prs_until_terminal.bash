# Project:      Juniper
# Sub-Project:  juniper-ml
# Application:  CI watch helper (ad-hoc)
# Author:       Paul Calnon

#
# Purpose: A `Monitor`-shaped wrapper around `util/wait_for_checks.py`: emit ONE
#          line per PR when it reaches a terminal state, exit when all have.
#
#          It adds exactly ONE thing the shared waiter does not cover, and that is
#          the only reason it exists: **unresolved review threads**. A PR can sit at
#          all-required-green and still be unmergeable because CodeQL posted a
#          review thread — measured three times on 2026-08-29 (canopy#537 at 23
#          SUCCESS / 0 failures held by two `py/mixed-returns`; ml#1444 by five
#          `File is not always closed`; ml#1480 by one `py/empty-except`). So each
#          line reports fail=, threads= and mergeState= together.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DO NOT REPLACE THE wait_for_checks.py CALL WITH A HAND-ROLLED POLL. Two versions
# of this script already did, and each hit a documented trap within the hour:
#
#   v1 called `gh pr checks --json`, a flag gh 2.46.0 does not have. It exits
#   "unknown flag" with status 0, so the loop saw an empty result, hit `continue`,
#   and emitted NOTHING for 45 minutes — indistinguishable from "still running".
#
#   v2 polled `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` and treated "no entry has a
#   null conclusion" as terminal. **The rollup GROWS as jobs start**: it held 7
#   entries mid-run where the finished suite had 26, so a lull between waves reads
#   as completion. It declared ml#1480 terminal while `Analyze (python)` was still
#   QUEUED — the exact trap `wait_for_checks.py --anchor observed` exists to
#   reproduce, and which its default (anchor on the ruleset's REQUIRED contexts)
#   prevents.
#
# The general rule both violated: **terminal must be defined POSITIVELY, against a
# closed set.** "Everything I can see is done" is not "it is done", because what
# you can see is open-ended. Anchor on the required contexts; let the shared waiter
# do it.

# Usage:
#   util/ad-hoc/watch_prs_until_terminal.bash juniper-ml:1480 juniper-canopy:537
#
# Env: OWNER (default pcalnon). PER_PR_TIMEOUT (default UNSET: the waiter then
#      waits each repo's measured CI budget from util/safe_merge.py REPO_TIMEOUTS,
#      as the merge path does). It used to default to a flat 2400 s, below six of
#      the nine budgets (up to 3300 s), so a healthy PR on those repos could report
#      TIMEOUT while its required contexts were still legitimately running.
#
# Exit: 0 once all watched PRs are terminal, 1 if any timed out, 2 on bad
#       invocation or a broken probe.
