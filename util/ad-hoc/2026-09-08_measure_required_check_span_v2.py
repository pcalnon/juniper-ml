Status:      ad-hoc -- measurement (re-run whenever the required-context list changes)
Retire when: RETAINED (owner policy 2026-08-25 -- no retirement deadline), as for the v1 tool.
Related:     util/ad-hoc/2026-08-20_measure_required_check_span.py (v1, superseded by this);
             util/safe_merge.py REPO_TIMEOUTS; util/wait_for_checks.py (the canonical waiter).

WHY A V2
--------
v1's docstring states the right quantity:

    max(completed_at) - min(started_at)      over the REQUIRED contexts on ONE head SHA

and its code computes a different one. It fetches `check-runs?per_page=100` and filters
NOTHING, so every advisory, bot and out-of-band check-run on the SHA enters the span.

Measured on `pcalnon/juniper-cascor#626` (head 00498948):

    real CI pass          06:58:57Z -> 07:09:02Z        605 s
    `claude` check-run    12:52:24Z -> 12:52:24Z          0 s   (5.7 h later, NOT required)
    v1 reported span                                  21207 s

The 20,602 s in the middle is idle. Nothing was running, and `safe_merge` never waits for
it: it waits for the required contexts that are pending NOW. So the number that sizes every
`REPO_TIMEOUTS` entry in the fleet measures a quantity the budget is not spent on.

Three consequences, all of them observed rather than argued:

  * **The p90 is unstable by ~3x on sample size alone.** juniper-cascor: p90 720 s at n=12,
    739 s at n=13, 2121 s at n=30 -- because the estimator index steps onto or off a parked
    head. Two runs of the same command minutes apart reported 2940 s and 720 s.
  * **"3x max" is unusable.** It yields 63,621 s for cascor and 124,191 s for canopy, well
    past the ~3600 s worker lease, so the rule the v1 tool prints cannot be applied.
  * **`tests/test_safe_merge.py::test_default_timeout_is_sized_from_measurement` cannot
    fail.** Its band is `(p90, 4*p90]`; with p90 itself swinging 3x, every candidate budget
    -- including the 900 s that REFUSED ml#1754 live -- sits inside it at some sample size.

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES **NOT** MEASURE -- read before sizing a budget from it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The span starts at `min(started_at)` over the required contexts, so it EXCLUDES the delay
between pushing a head and the first required check starting. `safe_merge` waits through
that delay when it is invoked right after a push, so its worst-case wait is

    queue + span,   not span

and a budget sized on span alone systematically undercounts it. Measured 2026-09-08, head
commit time against first required-context start:

    juniper-deploy #207     06:47:59Z -> 06:48:03Z        4 s
    juniper-deploy #206     07:53:45Z -> 07:54:18Z       33 s
    juniper-cascor #623     11:20:22Z -> 11:26:15Z      353 s

So the term is usually negligible and occasionally minutes. It is also CONTENTION-dependent
rather than a property of the repo: juniper-ml run 34293438446 sat `queued` for over eight
minutes on 2026-09-09 under concurrent session load, which is what made `safe_merge` refuse
ml#1828 at its 1500 s budget on a PR whose 17 required contexts all passed.

That refusal is the designed behaviour, not a sizing failure. `safe_merge` arms a server-side
auto-merge net precisely because a local wait cannot be made long enough to survive runner
starvation -- its own docstring says so. Do NOT inflate `REPO_TIMEOUTS` to absorb a queue:
that is how a stuck check becomes indistinguishable from a slow one, which is the single
distinction the timeout exists to draw. Size on span, and let the net carry the tail.

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES DIFFERENTLY
-------------------------------
  1. **Filters to the repo's actual required contexts**, read from its rulesets, so an
     advisory or bot check-run cannot enter the span.
  2. **Reads BOTH check-runs and legacy commit statuses.** A required context is either one
     or the other; `util/wait_for_checks.py:253-254` names this Trap 1, and v1 saw only
     check-runs.
  3. **Refuses a vacuous measurement.** A head whose required contexts are entirely absent
     is reported UNMEASURABLE and excluded, never counted as a small span; if no head is
     measurable the run exits 2. A correct predicate over an empty site enumeration is the
     failure this whole family of tools keeps re-introducing.
  4. **Reports coverage and `n` in the output**, because a p90 quoted without its sample
     size cannot be re-derived -- which is why the 2026-09-05 juniper-ml re-tier could not
     be reproduced.

It also prints v1's unfiltered span alongside, so the correction is auditable rather than
asserted.

KNOWN DEFECT -- LATER EXECUTIONS INFLATE THE SPAN (found 2026-09-22; NOT corrected in place)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`head_rows` reads check-runs with the API's default `filter=latest`, which keeps the latest
check-run per name WITHIN EACH WORKFLOW RUN. Two consequences:

  * a RE-RUN ATTEMPT replaces its run's earlier attempt -- and the jobs that passed are COPIED
    into the new attempt with their original timestamps -- so the span runs from the pass's
    original start to the re-run's finish;
  * a workflow run started by a LATER EVENT on the same head (a PR edit re-firing `Guard PR
    base branch`, a second trigger) is a different run, is not replaced, and enters the span.

    juniper-canopy#653      first pass FAILED at 10:08Z; two jobs re-run at 19:01Z   33,299 s
    juniper-recurrence#175  two run sets fired 1 s apart; concurrency cancelled 5
                            required contexts and 4 aggregators failed; the cancelled
                            pre-commit run was re-run 2.7 h later, merge 4 s after it  9,886 s

A later execution is not part of the pass `safe_merge` waited on, and both figures exceed
4x p90, so the sizing rule cannot be satisfied over them. The raw max printed here is an
upper bound, not the healthy worst case. Size budgets from
`util/ad-hoc/2026-09-22_ci_budget_handoff_reprobe.py first-pass`: each head's FIRST PASS (the
first execution of every required context, over `filter=all`), over heads whose first pass
passed. It drops no head for a repeat. An earlier rule dropped a head whenever a same-name
check-run started after another had completed; it set aside 18 heads, 13 of them healthy (their
only repeat was a successful `Guard PR base branch` run), and dropping heads can only LOWER a
max, the unsafe direction for a "budget > max" rule.

Usage
-----
    python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_measure_required_check_span_v2.py --repo juniper-cascor -n 30
    python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_measure_required_check_span_v2.py --repo juniper-ml -n 30 --verbose

Exit: 0 measured; 1 no merged heads to sample; 2 nothing measurable (vacuous run refused).
