# `util/ad-hoc/` — Single-use, temporary, and unfinished scripts

This directory is the home for scripts that:

- Will run once (or a handful of times) and then be retired.
- Are work-in-progress and not yet ready for promotion to `util/` proper.
- Support a one-off investigation, migration, or analysis tied to a specific PR / incident.

It exists because the alternative — authoring such scripts in `/tmp/` — caused real, irrecoverable loss in the v1–v4 requirements-snapshot effort (`phase4_consolidate.py`, `v2_citation_validate.py`). See [`../../notes/REQUIREMENTS_NEXT_STEPS.md` §7](../../notes/REQUIREMENTS_NEXT_STEPS.md#7-stale--drift-detection) and [plan-doc §12](../../notes/REQUIREMENTS_IDENTIFICATION_PLAN_2026-05-11.md#12-open-issues--questions-discovered-during-execution).

The repo-level rule lives in [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#script-placement-mandatory); the ecosystem-level restatement lives in the parent `Juniper/AGENTS.md` "Cross-Project Conventions" section (one directory above this repo, outside the juniper-ml git tree).

## Conventions

### File header (Python)

Every Python script in this directory should declare its scope and lifecycle inline:

```python
"""
<one-line purpose>

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: <name>
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: ad-hoc — <intent: one-off | wip | migration | investigation>
Retire when: <condition that makes this script obsolete>
Related: <PR #, incident, or notes/ doc>
"""
```

### File header (bash)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# <one-line purpose>
#
# Project:    juniper-ml
# Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
# Author:     <name>
# Created:    YYYY-MM-DD
# Status:     ad-hoc — <one-off | wip | migration | investigation>
# Retire when: <condition>
# Related:    <PR #, incident, notes/ doc>
set -euo pipefail
```

### Naming

- Date-prefix optional but useful: `YYYY-MM-DD_<short-purpose>.{py,bash}`.
- Use kebab-case or snake_case consistently — match existing siblings.

## Lifecycle

| Stage                                 | Action                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Created**                           | Place here. Include the header above with `Retire when:` populated.                                               |
| **Used for its purpose**              | Commit any non-trivial output / log alongside the script (e.g., in `notes/`) so the artifact survives the script. |
| **Graduates to permanent utility**    | Move to `util/<name>` (drop `ad-hoc` from the header `Status:`). Update any docs that referenced the old path.    |
| **Retired (purpose complete or obsolete)** | Delete in the same PR that completes the work, OR move to `util/ad-hoc/retired/` with the retirement date in the filename. Don't leave dead scripts behind. |

## What does NOT belong here

- Scripts that are part of a documented build / test / release flow → `util/` proper or `scripts/`.
- Scripts called by CI workflows → `util/` proper (CI should never invoke `util/ad-hoc/`).
- Tests → `tests/`.
- Generated artifacts (lockfiles, dep docs, build output) → wherever the build tooling expects.
