"""Live probe: is `expectedHeadOid` on auto-merge enable-time or continuously enforced?

Project:     Juniper
Sub-Project: juniper-ml
Application: ad-hoc investigation tooling

Created:     2026-08-21
Status:      ad-hoc -- investigation (one-off)
Retire when: RETAINED (owner policy 2026-08-25 — no retirement deadline). Previously: defect D4 in util/safe_merge.py is closed either way.
Related:     notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-19_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_SAFE-MERGE-KILL-FORENSICS.md (D4)
Superseded:  for new use by util/push_signed_commit.py, which pins --expected-head the same way, refuses a short sha and reads the commit back; RETAINED here as provenance (owner policy 2026-08-25).

The question
------------
`safe_merge`'s LOCAL merge path pins the exact head with `--match-head-commit`. Its ARMED
auto-merge net does not, and that trade was shipped silently (defect D4). `gh pr merge`
accepts `--auto --match-head-commit` together and maps it to
`EnablePullRequestAutoMergeInput.expectedHeadOid` -- verified, because passing an abbreviated
SHA returns *"Could not coerce value ... to GitObjectID"* from that exact input type.

So the flag composes. The open question is what the OID means afterwards:

  * **enable-time check** -- an optimistic-concurrency guard against arming on a stale read.
    Harmless to add, and a real improvement.
  * **continuously enforced** -- the net dies the moment the head moves. On a `strict=true`
    repo GitHub moves the head ITSELF to satisfy the up-to-date rule, so the net would
    evaporate exactly when it is needed. Adding the flag would silently negate D1.

Docs do not settle it: `MergePullRequestInput.expectedHeadOid` says *"OID that the pull
request head ref must match to allow merge; if omitted, no check is performed"*, but the
`EnablePullRequestAutoMergeInput` field description is a bare *"The expected head OID of the
pull request."* Neither mentions ongoing validation. That is suggestive, not decisive -- and
a wrong guess here is silent and total, so it gets measured.

Method
------
Open a throwaway PR that CANNOT merge (a markdown file with no H1 fails markdownlint MD041,
so Pre-commit goes red and every required context stays unsatisfied). Arming a net on it is
therefore safe. Then arm WITH the pin, move the head, and re-read `autoMergeRequest`.

Safety: the probe PR is never mergeable while armed, and is disarmed + closed + deleted
afterwards. This script only moves the head; arming/reading/cleanup are separate steps so
each result is observed rather than inferred.

Usage
-----
    python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-08-21_d4_expected_head_oid_probe.py --pr 1225 --expected-head <sha>
