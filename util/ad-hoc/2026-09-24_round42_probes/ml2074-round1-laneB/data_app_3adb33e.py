        **This is deliberately byte-identical to FastAPI's built-in handler.** Nothing
        about the response changes; what changes is who decides it. Until this existed,
        the 422 body -- and specifically the fact that ``detail`` is a *list* of error
        objects rather than a string -- was a framework default that no test in this repo
        pinned. ``juniper-data-client`` parses exactly that list (``APD-DCLIENT-003``:
        ``_render_error_detail`` renders it, and ``exc.detail`` exposes it unmodified), so
        a FastAPI upgrade that reshaped its default would have broken a published client
        with nothing here failing first.

        **``detail`` shape is status-dependent, and that is the known limitation.**
        This handler answers with ``list[dict]``; the ``ValueError`` and ``Exception``
        handlers below, and every ``HTTPException`` raised in a route, answer with
        ``str``. Unifying the two shapes needs a response envelope (RFC 9457 problem
        details), which is a separate, deliberately deferred piece of work -- see the
        defect register's ``APD-DATA-026``--``-033``. Flattening the list here is NOT the
        interim fix: it would destroy the per-field structure the client was just built
        to consume. The contract is therefore documented and pinned rather than changed.
