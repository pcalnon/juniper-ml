Triage the canopy E2E findings ledger by priority and open/fixed status.

Phase 2's exit criterion (plan §6.3) is "every P0 and P1 closed or explicitly
deferred with owner sign-off", so the arc needs a mechanical count of what is
still open at each priority rather than a hand-maintained list that drifts.

Reads the evidence note's ledger entries -- each is a ``**F-<AREA>-<NNN> — …**``
bold header carrying its priority and status inline -- and prints a triage table
plus totals.
