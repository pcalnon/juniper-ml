# File:    worktree_sweep_survey.bash
# Author:  Paul Calnon
# Created: 2026-05-31
# Purpose: One-shot survey of /home/pcalnon/Development/python/Juniper/worktrees/
#          for stale-worktree cleanup. Classifies each worktree as:
#           SAFE   — clean working tree + branch fully merged to origin/main
#                    (or branch already deleted on remote, or has no
#                    commits beyond origin/main).
#           ACTIVE — clean but has commits NOT in origin/main AND the
#                    branch is alive somewhere. Leave alone unless we
#                    can confirm the work is abandoned.
#           DIRTY  — uncommitted changes. NEVER touch.
#           BROKEN — worktree is in an inconsistent state (missing
#                    branch, detached HEAD on a deleted commit, etc.).
#                    Manual triage required.
#          Prints a tab-separated report to stdout; emits no destructive
#          actions. Pair with worktree_sweep_apply.bash to act on the
#          SAFE rows.
#
# Convention: this is an ad-hoc one-shot. Living under util/ad-hoc/ per
# the CLAUDE.md "Script placement" rule. Promote to util/ proper only if
# we end up running this more than twice.
