Pointer-follow soak instrument -- section 6 of the shared-session-memory plan
(``notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-18_JUNIPER-ML_SHARED-SESSION-MEMORY-PLAN.md``).
Protocol: ``notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-20_JUNIPER-ML_POINTER-FOLLOW-SOAK-LEDGER.md``.

WHY v0.2 EXISTS -- v0.1 could not falsify the bet
--------------------------------------------------
Three independent reviews (statistical, decision-theoretic, adversarial) found
the same dominant defect: **the denominator was conditioned on the outcome.**
An occasion was recorded only if someone NOTICED a relocated fact was relevant,
but the dominant failure of a pointer architecture is *the agent never knew the
fact existed* -- and that agent cannot notice. Follows were logged at ~100%,
ignorance-misses at ~0%. At q_miss ~ 0.26 a true 0.70 printed as exactly 0.900.

Every error term in v0.1 had the same sign. Nothing in it could make the
measured rate look worse than the truth. That is a confirmation procedure with
error bars, not a falsification test.

THE TWO ARMS
------------
**seeded** (verdict-bearing). Each row is one run of a PRE-REGISTERED PROBE from
``conf/soak_probes.json`` -- a task that cannot be done correctly without a
specific relocated fact. The denominator is fixed before the session starts, so
q_miss == q_follow == 1 and the estimate is unbiased. Fifteen seeded runs are
worth more than sixty self-reported ones.

**organic** (descriptive only). Opportunistic self-report. Retained because it
is free and occasionally shows something, but it is NEVER used for a verdict and
is reported explicitly as an UPPER BOUND with a q_miss sensitivity row.

VERDICTS ARE ON THE INTERVAL, NOT THE POINT ESTIMATE
----------------------------------------------------
v0.1 compared a point estimate to 0.90. That threshold is unreachable: a Wilson
lower bound clearing 0.90 needs 35 consecutive perfect runs, and at a TRUE rate
of exactly 0.90 the old rule fired BET-HOLDS only 55% of the time -- ~55% power
against its own hypothesis. v0.2 tests the Wilson interval against a single
reachable boundary and NAMES THE VERDICT AFTER WHAT WAS PROVEN, so a 0.75-grade
interval cannot print a word that authorises the P5 fleet rollout.

    exactly ``MIN_DISTINCT_PROBES`` (15), and P18 is down to a single live run, so ONE

    Distinct from both siblings: ``invalidate`` says the run should never have
    counted; ``resolve`` discharges an escalation that was real and has been
    fixed; ``rescore`` says the run happened and counts, but was filed under the
    wrong outcome.

    Only ``source-recovered`` is accepted as a TARGET, deliberately. An open-ended
    re-score verb is a way to move any inconvenient row to any convenient column,
    and the whole reason this exists is that 9 of 11 architectural misses were
    CORRECT answers reached from source. Widening it needs the same scrutiny this did.

    It does NOT remove the run from the follow-rate denominator -- see the
    ``rescored`` note in ``analyse``. If it did, this command would convert the
    standing INCONCLUSIVE verdict into a pass by redefinition.

    SOURCE WIDENED 2026-09-15: ``follow`` may now be re-scored, not only ``miss``.
    Owner ruling on handoff section 6 item 7 -- the binding retrieval standard is
    MECHANISM-CHECKED: apply the protocol's own section 4 definition (inputs union
    results), then discard hits that are not the destination document at all.
    Expressing that requires moving a ``follow`` DOWN, which the previous
    ``!= "miss"`` guard forbade outright.

    WHAT IS ACTUALLY GUARANTEED -- and it is NARROWER than "monotone in the safe
    direction", which an earlier draft of this docstring claimed and which is FALSE.
    Because ``RESCORE_OUTCOMES`` remains ``("source-recovered",)``:

      * no re-score can ever produce a ``follow`` -- pinned by
        ``tests/test_soak_handoff_consensus_checks.py::test_rescore_does_not_invent_a_follow``;
      * so no re-score can raise ``rate``, and none can turn a failing verdict into
        ``HOLDS-AT-``.

    THREE CONSEQUENCES THAT RUN THE OTHER WAY. State them; do not let the guarantee
    above stand in for them.

    1. **It desensitises the rung-3 area detector.** ``pooled_miss = 1 - rate`` is the
       null for the Bonferroni area test, so LOWERING ``rate`` RAISES the null and
       makes ``binom_sf(...) <= AREA_ALPHA / n_areas`` LESS likely to fire. Measured on
       the real corpus, area ``worktrees`` (2/4) moved p 0.51675 -> 0.61290 across the
       2026-09-15 re-scores. Latent only because 2 < ``AREA_MIN_MISSES``; that is an
       accident of this corpus, not a property of the verb.
    2. **It entrenches a terminal verdict.** Consecutive follows needed to lift the
       Wilson upper back over the boundary went 3 -> 10 across the same two re-scores,
       with no new data -- and ``util/soak_run_probe.py`` refuses to generate that data
       on a terminal verdict without ``--force``. A wider margin keeping a billed study
       closed IS a convenient column under the 2026-08-31 guard's actual wording.
    3. **``retention`` cannot fall.** ``follow -> source-recovered`` leaves it exactly
       unchanged (f-1, sr+1, n same), so under the widened verb retention only rises or
       holds while ``rate`` can be driven arbitrarily low. Nothing gates on retention,
       so this is a REPORTING hazard, not a control hazard -- but the reportable pair
       converges on "pointer failed / relocation safe" by re-interpretation alone.

    The two moves expressible are ``miss -> source-recovered`` (raises retention;
    owner-approved 2026-08-31) and ``follow -> source-recovered`` (lowers ``rate``;
    owner-approved 2026-09-15). Neither can rescue a failing bet; both can make one
    harder to reopen.

    ``source-recovered`` is deliberately NOT rescorable: it is the only target, so
    admitting it would permit a self-move, and a row already there has nowhere to go.
