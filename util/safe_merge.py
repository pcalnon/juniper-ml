Why this exists
---------------
Recommendation **R4** of
``notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-18_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_BRANCH-PROTECTION-INVESTIGATION-SYNTHESIS.md``.

Two independent audits measured that **12% of freshness-synced PRs merged before the
re-test they had just paid for could finish**. The cost of the sync was paid and its
benefit thrown away. Two concrete cases:

* **ml#932** merged **66 seconds** after its sync, on a head with **zero** CI check-runs.
  ``main`` then went red on Pre-commit x3.
* **ml#924** merged **25 seconds** after its update-branch head was created, again with no
  CI ever run on that head. It introduced the lint violation that reddened ``main``.

Both are *worse than not syncing at all*: the stale-but-tested head was replaced by a
fresh-but-untested one. GitHub did not stop either merge because the owner holds an
``always`` ruleset bypass, which makes every required check advisory for that actor.

This tool is the discipline that bypass removes. It refuses to merge unless the required
contexts for the PR's **current head** have all finished and none failed.

What it is NOT
--------------
**It is not enforcement.** A script can be skipped. Enforcement would mean narrowing the
owner's ``RepositoryRole 5`` bypass, which is a separate decision with its own costs (that
entitlement is genuinely load-bearing -- see the bypass analysis in ml#1012). Use this
because merging untested code is undesirable, not because something forces you to.

Surviving being killed
----------------------
A long wait is a liability: the script can be killed and then nothing finishes the merge. This
is not hypothetical and it is not rare -- see
``notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-19_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_SAFE-MERGE-KILL-FORENSICS.md``. The measured
mechanism (§3.4): a background task runs on a ``[bg]`` worker, spare workers hold a hard
**~3600 s lease**, and a task **cannot outlive its host worker**. A task placed on a fresh
spare gets an hour; the same command placed on a spare that is already 3372 s old gets 229 s.
The incident that motivated this net died exactly that way, matching the lease to 0.426 s.
**The runway is not knowable in advance and "it worked last time" predicts nothing.**

So whenever there is something to wait for, the merge is also handed to GitHub via
``gh pr merge --auto`` -- a **server-side** net that completes even if this process dies.
Auto-merge merges only once the required checks pass on the current head, so it carries the
same checks-green guarantee this tool enforces locally.

The net is **gated on the repo's ``allow_auto_merge``**, and that gate is load-bearing: where
the setting is false, ``--auto`` does not arm at all -- it silently falls back to an
**immediate merge**, which with the owner's ``always`` ruleset bypass can land a PR whose
checks never finished. Arming blind would reintroduce the exact bug this tool prevents.
(Enabled fleet-wide 2026-08-19; the gate stays because a setting can be turned off again.)

It is deliberately NOT armed on an already-green PR: there ``--auto`` merges on the spot,
skipping the head pinning below. ``--no-auto-fallback`` opts out entirely.

**What the net does and does not carry (D4).** Both paths now pass ``--match-head-commit``:
the local one at merge time, the net at ARMING time. But they are not the same guarantee, and
the difference is the part worth knowing.

``expectedHeadOid`` on ``enablePullRequestAutoMerge`` is an **enable-time** check, measured
rather than assumed (probe ml#1225: armed with a pin, pushed a commit to move the head, and
``autoMergeRequest`` was still present with an unchanged ``enabledAt``). So pinning the net
guards against **arming over a stale read** -- if the head moved between reading the PR and
arming, GitHub refuses instead of arming over a SHA this run never verified.

It does **not** keep pinning afterwards. Once armed, the net merges whatever head is current
when the checks pass. That is deliberate rather than merely tolerated: on a ``strict=true``
repo GitHub moves the head itself to satisfy the up-to-date rule, and a continuously-enforced
pin would kill the net exactly when it is needed. So the net still guarantees *"merges only
when required checks are green"* and not *"merges only the SHA this run vouched for"*.
Callers who need the stronger property should pass ``--no-auto-fallback`` and keep the run
alive.

**A refusal takes the net back down.** Any refusal after arming calls ``--disable-auto``
before propagating, so a refusal cannot quietly become a merge once the blocker clears. If
that teardown itself fails, the refusal says so **loudly** and names the PR -- that is the one
state where a stated refusal and a live server-side net coexist, and it must never be
silent.

The TOCTOU problem, and how it is handled
-----------------------------------------
Waiting for checks and then merging is a two-step operation, and the head can move in
between -- a push, or a concurrent session's ``update-branch``. Merging then lands a commit
whose checks were never the ones waited on, which is precisely the ml#924 shape.

So the resolved head SHA is captured **before** the wait and passed to
``gh pr merge --match-head-commit``. GitHub itself rejects the merge if the head moved.
The check is therefore enforced server-side, not by a local re-read that could race.

That guard earned its place on the **first live run** (ml#1170): the merge was rejected with
*"Head branch was modified"*. The cause was a bug here -- ``update-branch`` answers **202
Accepted** and moves the ref *asynchronously*, so reading the PR immediately returned the
OLD head; the tool then waited on that head's already-green checks and tried to merge a SHA
that no longer existed. ``update_branch`` now polls until the ref actually moves. Had the
guard not been there, the tool would have merged an untested head -- the very failure it was
written to prevent.

A rejected merge of that kind is a **refusal** (exit 1), not a hard error: nothing was
merged, which is the correct outcome.

Signing
-------
``BEHIND`` is repaired with ``gh api .../pulls/N/update-branch -X PUT`` -- a server-side
merge, therefore **GitHub-signed**, which ``required_signatures`` accepts fleet-wide. A
local merge + push is unsigned and would be rejected. No local git is used at any point;
this needs no checkout.

Usage
-----
    python util/safe_merge.py --pr 1170                      # dry-run: report only
    python util/safe_merge.py --pr 1170 --execute
    python util/safe_merge.py --pr 524 --repo juniper-cascor --execute
    python util/safe_merge.py --pr 42 --execute --merge-method merge

Exit codes
----------
0   merged (or, under --dry-run, would have merged)
1   REFUSED -- a stated reason (checks failed / still running / BEHIND loop exhausted /
    conflicts / not open / head moved). Nothing was merged.
2   misuse (bad arguments)
3   hard error (``gh`` missing or failing, PR not found)
4   INTERRUPTED -- a signal arrived mid-wait. This run merged nothing and the child waiter
    was killed. Distinct from 1 and 3 so a killed run is never read as a decision. NOTE: if
    an auto-merge net was armed it is **deliberately left up** -- surviving the kill is the
    entire point of the net -- so the PR may still merge server-side once its checks pass.
    The interrupt message says so explicitly.

A refusal is never silent, and a refusal takes the auto-merge net down before returning.

# CI-wait budget. HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE 2026-08-20 MEASUREMENT -- kept because it is why
# 900 s was abandoned, but every NUMBER in it is superseded. It was produced by
# `util/ad-hoc/2026-08-20_measure_required_check_span.py`, which despite its name filters
# nothing: advisory and bot check-runs on the head SHA enter the span, and the figures below
# overstate the observed max by 11x-110x depending on the repo. The live table is
# `REPO_TIMEOUTS` further down, re-measured 2026-09-08 with the v2 instrument.
#
# The previous 900 s was sized off "ci.yml median 251 s" -- one workflow, one repo. Measured
# across all required contexts the fleet spans differ by ~6x, and 900 s was BELOW the
# observed max on three of the four repos sampled. That conclusion survives the instrument
# correction; the numbers supporting it do not:
#
#   repo                   min  median    p90     max     n
#   juniper-ml             233     248     263     273    18
#   juniper-data           270     462    1100    1196    10
#   juniper-cascor         538     614    1065    1547    12
#   juniper-canopy         785     886    1371    1719    10
#
# 900 s sat essentially AT canopy's median, so roughly half of canopy's merges would have
# refused with "checks did not finish" while the checks were in fact still healthy. A
# spurious refusal is not harmless here: it is indistinguishable from a real blocker.
#
# Two more repos measured the same day, and the inference drawn from them was WRONG:
#
#   juniper-cascor-worker  314    493    1122    1717     8
#   juniper-cascor-client  177    564    6799   15616     8
#
# This comment used to read: "cascor-client's 15,616 s (4h20m) is a check sitting QUEUED, not
# CI doing work", and concluded that sizing must therefore be off the p90 and never the max.
#
# **It was not queue time.** It is the v1 instrument counting bot check-runs that attached to
# the head SHA hours after CI finished. Re-measured 2026-09-08 with the v2 tool over required
# contexts only, cascor-client's max is 1511 s across 30 heads with 0 unmeasurable -- a 19x
# overstatement, the same artifact seen on every other repo (cascor 11x, canopy 20x,
# data-client 27x, cascor-worker 70x, deploy 110x).
#
# The distinction the paragraph was defending is real and still holds: a budget must clear
# the typical worst case and then FIRE on a pathological tail, or a stuck check is
# indistinguishable from a slow one. What changed is that the "pathological tail" was an
# instrument artifact, so clearing the observed max is now both feasible and correct. Sizing
# is therefore off BOTH statistics -- `> observed_max` and `<= 4x p90` -- which is what
# `tests/test_safe_merge.py::test_default_timeout_is_sized_from_measurement` has always
# described in prose and, since 2026-09-08, actually asserts.
#
# The CEILING is a RISK threshold, not a hard bound -- an earlier version of this comment
# claimed it was the latter and that was wrong. What is measured (kill forensics §3.4):
# `[bg]` SPARE workers hold a ~3600 s lease, and 5 background tasks died at 3599.2-3600.0 s.
# What is NOT true is "a budget above 3600 s is unreachable": 8 background tasks in the same
# corpus ran past 3600 s and completed normally, the longest at 59,783 s (16.6 h). Those were
# presumably hosted by long-lived `slash` workers (30k-134k s) rather than spares -- but that
# is an inference, and the host kind is not knowable in advance from inside the task.
#
# So the honest statement: a wait longer than ~3600 s MAY be cut short depending on which
# worker happens to host it, and the caller cannot tell which. Capping below that keeps the
# local wait inside the window that is reliably available; past it, the armed auto-merge net
# is the answer rather than a longer local wait.

# RE-MEASURED FLEET-WIDE 2026-09-08, n=30, with
# `util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_measure_required_check_span_v2.py`. Every number below is the span
# of the repo's REQUIRED contexts only.
#
# The v1 instrument (`util/ad-hoc/2026-08-20_measure_required_check_span.py`) sized this
# table and measured the wrong thing. Its docstring says "over the REQUIRED contexts on ONE
# head SHA"; its code fetches `check-runs?per_page=100` and filters nothing, so advisory and
# bot check-runs enter the span. On cascor#626 a `claude` check-run attached to the head SHA
# 5.7 hours after CI finished, and v1 reported a 21,207 s span for a 605 s CI pass. Measured
# overstatement of the observed max: cascor 11x, canopy 20x, cascor-client 19x,
# data-client 27x, cascor-worker 70x, deploy 110x.
#
# Two consequences that were live in this table until today:
#   * juniper-cascor's 2400 s sat BELOW its own observed max (2561 s) -- a healthy cascor PR
#     at its worst was refused, the same failure that hit ml#1754;
#   * juniper-deploy and juniper-recurrence fell through to DEFAULT_TIMEOUT at 2400 s, which
#     is 9x their p90 -- a stuck run there looked merely slow for 40 minutes.
#
# Sizing rule, both halves now enforced by `KillResilienceTest`: the budget must CLEAR the
# observed max and stay inside 4x p90. Values are picked mid-window, not guessed.
#
# If a repo starts refusing healthy PRs, re-run the v2 tool with `-n 30` and record `n`
# alongside whatever you write here -- the 2026-09-05 juniper-ml re-tier could not be
# reproduced because its sample size was never written down.
#
# THESE BUDGETS COVER THE SPAN, NOT THE QUEUE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The measured span
# starts at the first required context's `started_at`, so it excludes the delay between
# pushing a head and CI starting on it -- which this tool DOES wait through when invoked
# right after a push. That delay is usually seconds (juniper-deploy: 4 s, 33 s) and
# occasionally minutes (juniper-cascor#623: 353 s), and it is a function of runner
# CONTENTION rather than of the repo.
#
# Observed 2026-09-09: run 34293438446 sat `queued` over eight minutes under concurrent
# session load, and this tool refused ml#1828 at 1500 s on a PR whose 17 required contexts
# every one passed. That is the design working, not a budget being wrong -- the armed
# auto-merge net completed the merge server-side minutes later.
#
# So do NOT raise a budget to absorb a queue. A budget large enough to sit through runner
# starvation is large enough that a genuinely stuck check looks merely slow, which is the
# one distinction this timeout exists to draw. Size on the span; let the net carry the tail.

    # #1828 1657, #1830 1529, #1831 1041, #1829 997 -- every one merged during a burst of

    # TWO JUSTIFICATIONS WITHDRAWN 2026-09-10; the VALUE stands on the measurement above.
    #
    # (1) This entry called ml's stretch WITHIN-span and "so distinct from the pre-start
    #     queue the note above says not to absorb", on the discriminator "which this tool
    #     does wait through". That discriminator DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE -- the note above
    #     says in terms that the pre-start delay is waited through as well. What actually
    #     separates them is measurement SCOPE: the span starts at the first required
    #     context's `started_at`, so pre-start queue never enters this number and no raise
    #     can absorb it, while within-span stretch is what the number is made of.
    #
    # (2) "Every one merged during a burst of concurrent sessions" was offered as evidence
    #     that ml's growth is CONTENTION. ml#1831 added a 181-line suite to three
    #     `Regression Tests` legs INSIDE this window, so ml's CI also genuinely got heavier
    #     -- by this arc's own hand. Both causes are present; the span cannot separate them.

    """Why this PR must not be merged through a net that carries a stored body.

    Returns a refusal reason, or None when the PR is safe to proceed with.

    THE HAZARD IS NOT THIS TOOL. Established 2026-09-11 by independent consensus over
    1877 PRs: ``gh pr merge --auto --<method>`` with no body flags OMITS ``commitBody``,
    so GitHub stores ``null`` -- and a history search for ``--body-file`` in this file
    returns no commits, in any version. This module has never supplied one. The one
    incident (ml#1228) was armed by something else, 5m42s AFTER this tool's own disarm.

    ``commitBody`` has THREE states and only one is safe:

    * ``null``  -- omitted. The repo's ``squash_merge_commit_message`` (COMMIT_MESSAGES on
      all nine repos) is resolved at MERGE time, so commits pushed after arming are still
      included. Measured: 60 post-arm commits across 48 PRs, ZERO losses, lags to 40.7h.
    * ``""``    -- an actual empty string, and NOT the same as null: the squash lands with
      no body at all. Eight cases here, all bodyless at source so none lost anything --
      but the state is real, and ``length`` cannot tell it from null. That indistinguish-
      ability is what produced the superseded diagnosis this function replaces.
    * non-empty -- an ARM-TIME SNAPSHOT that binds when the net fires. Of the 29 PRs where
      a single-parent commit landed AFTER the arm, 23 lost that commit's body from the
      squash message. ml#1228 lost an ``Allow-Symbol-Loss:`` waiver that way and
      ``Post-Merge Main Verification`` failed on the landed SHA three seconds later;
      ml#1877 silently lost nine commit messages.

    WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN REPAIR. The obvious remedy -- disarm, then re-arm with no body
    -- is not available to a merge GATE. ``--auto`` on a mergeable PR merges ON THE SPOT
    (see ``arm_auto_merge``), so a repair attempt can land a PR whose required checks never
    finished: ml#932 / ml#924, the exact failure this tool exists to prevent. That is not
    hypothetical -- the same disarm/re-arm sequence merged three sibling PRs on the spot on
    2026-09-11. It also cannot fail safe: if the disarm succeeds and the re-arm's
    ``--match-head-commit`` then fails -- which happens precisely when the head has moved,
    the common case -- the PR is left with NO net at all. So this reports and refuses; the
    operator decides.

    NOT A BLANKET BAN ON STORED BODIES. A body supplied AFTER the last commit is correct,
    and is the only way to guarantee a waiver trailer's exact text: twelve PRs here carry a
    deliberately curated message, and the alternative on a large PR is ml#1797's
    26,052-character auto-concatenation. The hazard is a body stored BEFORE further commits
    land. This therefore refuses only on the empty string, which is destructive
    unconditionally; staleness of a non-empty snapshot depends on commits this function
    cannot see, and is measured by
    ``util/ad-hoc/2026-09-10_soak_stopping_rule/armed_snapshot_staleness.py``.

    Idempotent: arming twice is a no-op, so callers may call this on every cycle.

    Armed only in ARMABLE_STATES -- on an already-green PR ``--auto`` merges on the spot,
    which would skip the head pinning the local path performs, so that case is deliberately
    left to the local path.

    ``head`` pins the arming to a specific SHA (D4). MEASURED before adding, because a wrong
    guess here would be silent and total: probe ml#1225 armed a net with
    ``--match-head-commit``, pushed a new commit to move the head, and re-read the PR --
    ``autoMergeRequest`` was still present with an UNCHANGED ``enabledAt``, so it had not
    been dropped and had not been silently re-armed.

    So ``expectedHeadOid`` on ``enablePullRequestAutoMerge`` is an ENABLE-TIME
    optimistic-concurrency guard, not a continuous constraint. That matters: had it been
    continuous, the net would evaporate the moment GitHub moved the head itself to satisfy
    ``strict``, which is exactly when it is needed -- silently negating D1. A push is a
    stronger head move than GitHub's own sync, and the net survived it.

    What pinning buys: the arming cannot be based on a stale read. If the head moved between
    ``pr_state`` and here, GitHub rejects the mutation instead of arming a net over a SHA
    this run never verified. The net still carries the weaker guarantee AFTER arming (it
    merges whatever head is current once checks pass) -- that part of D4 remains a stated
    trade, not a fixed one, and the docstring says so.

    Passing ``head=""`` skips the pin, which is the pre-D4 behaviour.
