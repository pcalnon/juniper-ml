"""Cross-repo drift detection for the ``juniper-doc-tools`` pin in
each consumer repo's CI workflow.

Plan §5.1 of ``notes/JUNIPER_DOC_TOOLS_PYPI_MIGRATION_PLAN_2026-05-18.md``:

   "A range that falls outside the supported window (more than 2 minor
   versions behind current) gets surfaced as a soft warning, not a
   hard fail. Hard fail only if the pin is for a version that has been
   yanked or pre-1.0."

This test runs in three modes:

1. **Weekly cross-repo CI** (``docs-full-check.yml``): all sibling
   Juniper repos are freshly cloned alongside juniper-ml. Cross-repo
   assertions run against those fresh checkouts.
2. **Per-PR CI** (``ci.yml``): only juniper-ml is checked out. The
   cross-repo assertion auto-skips (no siblings present), but the
   helper unit tests and juniper-ml's own pin check still run --
   catching the case where someone bumps juniper-doc-tools in this
   same PR but forgets to bump the pin in juniper-ml's workflows.
3. **Local dev** (no ``GITHUB_ACTIONS`` env var): the cross-repo
   assertion is gated behind ``GITHUB_ACTIONS=true``. Local sibling
   working trees can lag ``origin/main`` (a freshly merged consumer
   repo PR might not have been pulled), and that local-stale state
   would produce false positives. Set
   ``JUNIPER_DRIFT_TEST_FORCE_LOCAL=1`` to override and lint the
   local working trees anyway (useful when actively testing this
   suite itself).

The "current version" is read from this repo's
``juniper-doc-tools/pyproject.toml`` -- that file is the source of
truth for the in-development version, and the weekly workflow runs
against ``main``, so this is always the most-recently-released
version.

Yank detection is deliberately out of scope (would require a network
call to PyPI's JSON API on every test run; brittle and rarely
relevant). The check covers the common drift case: a consumer pin
ceiling that no longer permits the current version.
