Hermetic tests for ``util/markdown_structure_delta.py`` -- the CI gate that fails a PR which
BREAKS markdown structure without demanding a clean tree first.

``util/`` draws "(no files to check) Skipped" from every pre-commit Python hook, so this
unittest **is** the gate for that module.

The three things a gate like this gets wrong, each pinned here:

* **Red on arrival.** ``main`` measures **zero** structural problems as of 2026-09-15: the
  2026-09-10 repair cleared the real damage, and the 2026-09-15 rule narrowing cleared the last
  17, which were SCREEN FALSE POSITIVES rather than debt (a ``text``-tagged banner whose art
  lines begin ``##``, and a four-backtick ``jinja2`` template sample whose H2s are the sample).
  That count is a MOVING FLOOR, not a backlog: 104/23, 102/21, 63/14, 73/15, 63/14, 17/2, 0/0
  across ten days. No test here asserts it -- every fixture below is synthetic -- so re-measure
  before quoting it elsewhere. **Zero on main does not make the delta scoping redundant**: the
  count regresses the moment damage lands, and a gate demanding zero would then be unmergeable
  from that commit. Independently of the count, the comparison must be per-file and per-PR: a
  file the PR does not touch is not the PR's problem, and a file it touches must not come out
  worse than it went in.
* **Vacuous pass.** The underlying screen silently skips anything not ending ``.md``. A bad glob,
  a wrong base ref, or a sanitised temp filename examines nothing and reports success -- a
  correct predicate over an empty site enumeration. Examining zero of N touched files must be an
  error, not a pass.
* **A new file graded on a curve.** A file the PR ADDS has no "before", and defaulting its
  baseline to anything but zero would let a PR introduce a broken table in new prose.

Every fixture is a synthetic git repository under a temp dir. Nothing reads the live tree.

    # a temp repo inherits it. What happens next depends on GPG AGENT STATE, which is why it
    # is worth pinning rather than tolerating:
    #
    #   * agent able to sign non-interactively -> every fixture commit is signed for nothing.
    #     Measured 2026-09-09: 3.5 s, versus 0.96 s with signing off.

    #     FAILS. `base` is then unresolvable and four tests exit 2, "cannot resolve ref".
    #     Measured 2026-09-08 in exactly that state: 7 failures after 101 s of timeouts.
    #
    # So the suite was green or red depending on something no test controls, and CI never saw
    # the red half because a runner has no signing key. That is the worst shape for it: green
    # on the machine nobody debugs on. `tests/test_predict_merge.py` already does this.
