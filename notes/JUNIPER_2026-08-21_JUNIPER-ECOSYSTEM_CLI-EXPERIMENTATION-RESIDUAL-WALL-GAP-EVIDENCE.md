## 1. What this re-measures, and why the old number cannot be reused

The wide-budget campaign published **1.99 ± 0.21×** as the direct CLI's wall-clock penalty. That
number is **superseded**: all twelve of its runs were cascor `3909d27`, i.e. **pre-#531/#533**,
when `main.py` capped `OMP_/MKL_/OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` to 2 on the CLI path and the service path
was uncapped. The cap alone accounted for **1.30× of a 1.52×** candidate-phase penalty at cap 16.

What survives from that campaign, unchanged and re-confirmed here:

- **100% of the difference is the candidate phase.** The output phase is ~1.0×.
- **The total gap compounds per growth iteration**, which is why a 2-unit smoke run saw none of it.

What must be re-measured is the *magnitude* on post-#533 `main` — this document — and the two
things that had to be settled before the measurement was worth making at all.

### 1.1 Why this could not simply be re-run

Two prerequisites came out of the reproducibility campaign, and both change the design:

1. **The direct-CLI arm cannot support a single-run A/B.** It diverges in **0.768** of run-pairs
   [0.553, 0.847] at N=20; the service arm diverges in **0 of 190**. So the service side is a
   sound single-run instrument and the CLI side is not: every CLI figure here is a **k-paired**
   mean, never one run.
2. **The predecessor's timing was contaminated by block ordering, not by contention.** It ran all
   20 service cells and then all 20 CLI runs; over eight hours host load fell from ~38 to ~6, so
   one arm absorbed nearly all the contention. Its service arm did byte-identical work twenty
   times — 11,360 candidate epochs, `sd = 0` — and still spanned **825 s to 190 s**.

Point 2 is the design constraint that matters most, and it is worth stating precisely because the
obvious reading is wrong: **contention is not the enemy, drift across a block boundary is.** A load
that is merely *constant* cancels in a ratio. A load that *changes* between "all of arm A" and "all
of arm B" biases whichever arm ran during the busy half, and no amount of averaging within an arm
recovers it.

---

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Interleaved pairs, still strictly sequential

[`2026-08-21_h2h_paired_campaign.bash`](../util/ad-hoc/2026-08-21_h2h_paired_campaign.bash)
alternates **service, CLI, service, CLI …** so a pair's two legs are adjacent in time. Residual
drift then hits both legs of a pair roughly equally instead of accumulating against one arm.

The arms are never run *concurrently*. The workload is ~8 forked candidate workers at ~90% CPU
each; two arms at once would contend with each other and void the comparison outright.

### 2.2 The statistic: ratio-of-pairs

[`2026-08-21_h2h_paired_ratio.py`](../util/ad-hoc/2026-08-21_h2h_paired_ratio.py) forms the ratio
**inside** each pair and then averages those ratios. Averaging each arm first and dividing at the
end does not cancel the shared per-pair condition, and lets a single slow leg move the headline.

Both are printed. **When they disagree by more than 2% the tool says so**, because that
disagreement is itself the finding: it means the pairs were not seeing comparable hosts, and the
campaign needs re-running rather than re-interpreting.

The tool also derives the **number of pairs required** for a target precision from the observed
pairwise `sd`. The original failure mode of this whole arc was quoting a ratio from one run per
arm; "how many is enough" is now computed rather than asserted.

### 2.3 Guards that stop the campaign rather than warn

- **One cascor SHA across arms.** The driver refuses to start otherwise — and it earned that on
  its first invocation, catching a primary checkout one commit behind the CLI worktree.
- **One `config_sha256` across every service leg and the CLI's cell.** Each service leg
  re-materialises its own cell; if any differs from the cell the CLI arm was handed, the arms are
  running different experiments and the campaign stops.
- **`DATA_URL` verified against the launching stack's own `ports.json`** before any CLI leg runs,
  since `r5_stack_up.bash` resolves "the newest run dir carrying a `ports.json`" and a service leg
  coming up mid-campaign could otherwise re-point the CLI arm.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Cap 4 — a gap survives #533, and it is entirely throughput

Not a purpose-built pair campaign: this is extracted from the reproducibility campaign's own runs
(20 CLI, and the **6 service cells whose load window matches the CLI arm's**). It is included
because the match is good enough to be worth reporting and it supplies the smallest-cap point.

Load over the two windows is statistically indistinguishable — service mean **7.72** (range
5.97–11.75), CLI mean **7.99** (range 5.09–11.47) — which is the specific confound §1.1 point 2
warns about, and it is absent here.

| metric | service (n=6) | CLI (n=20) | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| training span | 192.5 s | 280.8 s | **1.459×** |
| candidate phase | 187.8 s | 276.1 s | **1.470×** |
| output phase | 3.83 s | 3.75 s | 0.978× |
| candidate epochs | 11,360 | 10,734 | **0.945×** |
| s / candidate epoch | 0.01652 | 0.02571 | **1.555×** |

Three things follow:

1. **A substantial gap survives #533.** Removing the BLAS entry-point asymmetry did not remove the
   penalty; at cap 4 the CLI's candidate phase is still ~1.47× the service's.
2. **It is 100% candidate-phase.** The output ratio is 0.978× — within noise of 1.0, and
   consistent with the wide-budget campaign's 1.03–1.05×.
3. **It is a throughput penalty, not extra work.** The CLI does **5.5% fewer** candidate epochs and
   still takes 1.47× as long; the per-epoch rate ratio is **1.555×**. Whatever the cause, it makes
   each epoch more expensive rather than causing more of them.

> **This is a cross-arm comparison and inherits §4.3 of the reproducibility note**: the two paths
> do not start from the same state on an identical cell. The 0.945× work ratio is partly that, not
> purely a scheduling difference. The *rate* ratio is the more robust of the two figures because it
> is normalised by the work each arm actually did.

### 3.2 Cap 16 — paired and interleaved, k=4

Suite `e-k-thread-probe-cap16-20260821T083547Z`, one `config_sha256` (`2a60040aff9d`) across all
four service legs and the CLI's cell, one stack (`20260821T085116Z-85cd`, `DATA_URL` verified).
Per-leg load1 ranged 2.66–7.13 across the whole campaign.

| pair | svc span | cli span | span× | svc cand | cli cand | cand× | svc epochs | cli epochs | work× | rate× |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 908 | 1607 | 1.770 | 890 | 1554 | 1.746 | 44,910 | 57,450 | 1.279 | 1.365 |
| 2 | 833 | 1306 | 1.568 | 816 | 1253 | 1.536 | 44,910 | 50,350 | 1.121 | 1.370 |
| 3 | 790 | 1525 | 1.930 | 773 | 1472 | 1.904 | 44,910 | 55,340 | 1.232 | 1.545 |
| 4 | 777 | 1299 | 1.672 | 761 | 1248 | 1.640 | 44,910 | 53,420 | 1.189 | 1.379 |

| paired ratio (CLI / service) | mean ± sd | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **training span** | **1.735 ± 0.154** | [1.584, 1.886] |
| **candidate phase** | **1.706 ± 0.157** | [1.552, 1.861] |
| output phase | 0.969 ± 0.108 | [0.863, 1.075] |
| **candidate work (epochs)** | **1.206 ± 0.067** | [1.140, 1.271] |
| **per-candidate-epoch rate** | **1.415 ± 0.087** | [1.329, 1.500] |

**The design validated itself.** Ratio-of-means is **1.734** against ratio-of-pairs **1.735** — they
agree to three decimals, which is what "the pairs saw comparable hosts" looks like. Had they
diverged, the campaign would have needed re-running rather than re-interpreting.

**The service column is the reproducibility result made visible.** All four service legs did
**exactly 44,910** candidate epochs — the 0/190 divergence rate in operational form. The CLI legs
ranged **50,350 to 57,450**, a 14% spread. That is precisely why k-pairing was mandatory here: a
single CLI run could have reported a work ratio of 1.12 *or* 1.28 with equal honesty.

#### 3.2a This supersedes the cap-16 figure the arc has been carrying

The residual has been tracked as **~1.17×** from the cap-16 `e-k` thread probe in juniper-cascor#531.
That probe was **one run per arm**:

| cap-16 candidate phase | #531 probe (n=1/arm) | this campaign (k=4, paired) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| phase ratio | 1.17× | **1.706×** [1.552, 1.861] |
| work ratio | 1.03× | **1.206×** [1.140, 1.271] |
| rate ratio | 1.14× | **1.415×** [1.329, 1.500] |

The single-run figures sit outside the k=4 intervals on every line. Two candidate explanations, and
they are not mutually exclusive:

1. **Sampling.** The CLI's candidate work varies 14% run to run (above), so a single CLI draw can
   land anywhere in a wide band. `1.03×` is inside that band.
2. **A real methodological difference.** #531's probe set `OMP_NUM_THREADS=16` **explicitly** on the
   CLI; this campaign runs the CLI at `default`, i.e. the variables **unset**, which is the shipped
   post-#533 behaviour and what the service does. Those are *intended* to be the same 16 threads,
   but "unset, library picks" and "explicitly 16" are not guaranteed to resolve identically —
   OpenMP and MKL both have defaulting heuristics that an explicit value bypasses.

**Not resolved here**, and worth stating plainly rather than picking the flattering reading. It is
cheaply testable — a few CLI legs at explicit `16` against the existing `default` legs — and is
recorded as an open item (§4.3a resolves it) rather than folded into the headline.

#### 3.2b The gap grows with cap, but not in the way the decomposition suggests

| | cap 4 | cap 16 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| candidate phase | 1.470× | **1.706×** |
| candidate work | 0.945× | **1.206×** |
| per-epoch rate | 1.555× | **1.415×** |
| output phase | 0.978× | 0.969× |

The total gap grows, and it is the **work** term that drives it — flipping from the CLI doing 5.5%
*less* work at cap 4 to 20.6% *more* at cap 16. The **rate** term moves the other way, easing from
1.555× to 1.415×.

That is consistent with two separate effects rather than one: a roughly constant per-epoch overhead
that matters less as the matrices grow, plus a divergence in *when candidate early stopping fires*
that compounds as the network deepens. The output phase stays at ~1.0× throughout, so none of this
is the output layer.

**It also means neither cap licenses an extrapolation to cap 64** — the two terms move in opposite
directions, so the product is not something to fit a line through. Hence §3.3.

### 3.3 Cap 64 — paired, k=4, and the result splits in two

Suite `e-m-h2h-paired-cap64-20260821T111154Z`, one `config_sha256` (`2bf1b3c6af6a`), one verified
stack, ~10 h. Per-leg load1 3.77–7.14.

| pair | svc span | cli span | span× | svc epochs | cli epochs | work× | rate× |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 2737 | 5780 | 2.112 | 134,500 | 221,580 | 1.647 | 1.289 |
| **2** | 2478 | **2967** | **1.197** | 134,500 | **122,840** | **0.913** | **1.316** |
| 3 | 2372 | 5195 | 2.190 | 134,500 | 212,020 | 1.576 | 1.402 |
| 4 | 2500 | 5492 | 2.197 | 134,500 | 225,980 | 1.680 | 1.317 |

| paired ratio | mean ± sd | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| training span | 1.924 ± 0.486 | [1.448, 2.400] |
| candidate phase | 1.937 ± 0.492 | [1.455, 2.420] |
| output phase | 0.900 ± 0.271 | [0.635, 1.166] |
| **candidate work** | **1.454 ± 0.363** | [1.098, 1.810] |
| **per-candidate-epoch rate** | **1.331 ± 0.049** | [1.283, 1.379] |

Ratio-of-means 1.927 against ratio-of-pairs 1.924 — the pairs saw comparable hosts.

**Pair 2 is not an anomaly to discard; it is the reproducibility defect in the wall clock.** Its CLI
leg did **122,840** candidate epochs where the other three did 212k–226k — roughly half the work,
on a byte-identical config. The service leg did **exactly 134,500** in all four pairs. That is
cascor#532 (direct-CLI divergence rate 0.768) expressed as wall time.

#### 3.3a The finding: one stable term and one stochastic term

The single most useful thing in this table is that **the rate ratio barely moves while the work
ratio swings 2×**:

| pair | work× | rate× |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1.647 | 1.289 |
| 2 | **0.913** | 1.316 |
| 3 | 1.576 | 1.402 |
| 4 | 1.680 | 1.317 |

Work ranges 0.913–1.680 (sd 0.363, cv 25%). Rate ranges 1.289–1.402 (sd 0.049, **cv 3.7%**), and
pair 2 — the one that did half the work — sits in the middle of the rate band.

The analyser's own sizing says the same thing: for a 0.05 half-width the span needs **k=363** and
the rate needs **k=4, already SUFFICIENT**.

So "the CLI is ~1.9× slower" is a poor headline. The gap is:

> **a STABLE ~1.33× per-candidate-epoch throughput penalty — the genuine path difference —
> multiplied by a VARIABLE amount of work the CLI happens to do, which is cascor#532 and not a
> performance property at all.**

Those are different defects with different owners. The rate term is what the fix should target (§4.4 → cascor#563). The work
term is already tracked as G1/G1a and is only reducible by making the CLI path reproducible.

#### 3.3b The cap series — the compounding is entirely the work term

| cap | span× | work× | rate× | output× | work × rate | measured phase× |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 | 1.459 | 0.945 | 1.555 | 0.978 | 1.469 | 1.470 |
| 16 | 1.735 | 1.206 | 1.415 | 0.969 | 1.706 | 1.706 |
| 64 | 1.924 | 1.454 | 1.331 | 0.900 | 1.935 | 1.937 |

The decomposition closes to within 0.002 at every cap, so the two terms are a complete account of
the candidate phase.

Read across the rows: **work grows monotonically (0.945 → 1.454) while rate falls monotonically
(1.555 → 1.331).** The much-quoted "the gap compounds per growth iteration" is true of the total —
and it is *entirely* the work term doing it. The per-epoch penalty actually *improves* with cap, as
larger matrices amortise a fixed overhead.

This is why §3.2b warned against extrapolating: a fit through the total would have been fitting the
product of two opposing trends.

#### 3.3c #533 did not measurably reduce the cap-64 gap

The wide-budget campaign measured **1.99 ± 0.21×** pre-#533, with the CLI arm carrying `main.py`'s
`OMP=2` cap that juniper-cascor#531 valued at **1.30× of a 1.52×** candidate-phase penalty at
cap 16. Removing that cap should therefore have moved the cap-64 headline substantially.

Measured post-#533 at k=4: **1.924 ± 0.486** — squarely overlapping the pre-#533 1.99 ± 0.21.

Two caveats before this is read as "#533 achieved nothing": the designs differ (ml#1143 used three
*different* seeds, this uses one seed × four replicates), and my interval is wide because of the
work term. But the comparison is informative in the same direction as §3.2a: **#531's 1.30×
thread-cap attribution also rests on single runs**, and single-run attributions in this system have
now twice failed to survive k=4. Testing that is the OMP control in §4.3a.

## 4. Root cause

### 4.1 Thread context is eliminated — it explains the determinism, not the speed

The reproducibility campaign found that the two entry points run `fit()` on different threads
(service on a `ThreadPoolExecutor` worker, CLI on the main thread) and that moving the CLI onto a
pool thread cuts its divergence rate from 0.768 to 0.337.

It is a natural next thought that the same difference explains the *wall* gap — one mechanism, both
symptoms. **It does not.** From that campaign's own N=20 arms, at cap 4:

| CLI variant | training span |
| --- | ---: |
| baseline — `fit()` on the main thread | 280.8 ± 14.7 s |
| probe — `fit()` on a pool thread | 282.9 ± 5.7 s |

Moving to a pool thread changed the wall time by **0.7%**, well inside the spread, while the
service arm under a matched load window sat at 192.5 s. The thread-context difference is therefore
**not** the wall-clock mechanism, and the two symptoms have different causes.

Recording this as an elimination rather than a footnote: it was the leading hypothesis going in,
and it is cheap for a later reader to re-propose.

### 4.2 The work term — the two paths train DIFFERENT CANDIDATES, by three draws

`candidate_seeds` are drawn once per growth iteration from the **parent's stdlib `random` stream**
(`cascade_correlation.py:2298`), not derived from the configured `random_seed`. Logged on both arms
from one instrumented build:

```
SERVICE round 0: [698594025, 1525876051, 2878380452, 2727210979, 1051454923, 1985392498, 240251661, 3529615275]
CLI     round 0: [                                    2727210979, 1051454923, 1985392498, 240251661, 3529615275, 3457645390, 1722989659, 284277889]
SERVICE round 1: [3457645390, 1722989659, 284277889, 3083418319, …]
```

Line them up. The CLI's round-0 list **begins at the service's 4th element**, and its last three are
the service's **round-1 first three**. Both arms walk the *same* deterministic stream — the CLI is
simply **offset by exactly three draws**, and stays offset for the whole run.

**So the two paths do not train the same candidates, and never did.** Not because of a seed
mismatch — `network_seed=42` on both — but because something on the CLI path consumes three extra
values from `random` before the first candidate round, and candidate seeds are *positional* on that
stream.

Consequences, in order of how much they matter:

1. **Part of the measured work ratio is "different candidates", not "slower path".** A candidate
   seeded differently trains for a different number of epochs. The work term (0.945× / 1.206× /
   1.454× across the caps) is therefore *not* purely a path property, and any fix that equalises
   the seeds will move it.
2. **It is fragile in a way nothing declares.** Adding a single `random` call anywhere on either
   path — logging, a retry, a shuffle — silently re-seeds every candidate in every subsequent
   round. Nothing would fail; the numbers would just change.
3. **It makes any cross-path comparison structurally suspect** unless the two paths happen to have
   consumed the same number of draws first, which nothing checks or guarantees.

The fix is small and obvious: derive candidate seeds from `(network_seed, iteration,
candidate_index)` rather than by drawing from a shared global stream. That makes them a function of
configuration alone and independent of draw history. Carried into the fix design (F4, implemented and verified).

### 4.3 The rate term — NOT pool packing; the penalty is real

§3.3a's stable ~1.33× per-epoch penalty was measured as candidate-phase wall ÷ **total** epochs.
That is not a per-epoch cost. A round runs 8 candidates over 7 workers, so at least one worker runs
two sequentially and the round's wall is set by the **busiest worker's critical path**, not the
total. A path whose candidates finish unevenly looks slower per epoch than one whose candidates
finish together, at identical arithmetic cost.

[`2026-08-21_h2h_pool_balance.py`](../util/ad-hoc/2026-08-21_h2h_pool_balance.py) computes the
critical path per round (LPT: sort candidates descending, greedily assign to the least-loaded
worker) and an imbalance figure — critical ÷ perfect-split:

| arm | rounds | total epochs | critical epochs | imbalance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| service | 16 | 45,199 | 9,685 | 1.533 ± 0.460 |
| CLI | 16 | 56,095 | 12,561 | 1.552 ± 0.280 |
| **CLI / service** | | **1.241×** | **1.297×** | **1.012×** |

**Imbalance is 1.012× — the two arms pack equally badly.** Both waste ~53% over a perfect split,
and neither is worse than the other. Pool packing is therefore *not* what separates them, and the
rate penalty is a genuine per-epoch cost difference: **profiling should target the worker
environment, not the scheduler.**

One correction falls out of the same table, and it goes against the headline. The correct
denominator (critical epochs, 1.297×) is larger than the one the rate column uses (total epochs,
1.241×), so measuring against totals **overstates the per-epoch penalty by ~4.5%**. Applied to the
cap-16 figure, 1.415× becomes ≈**1.354×**; the cap-64 1.331× shifts similarly. The penalty is real
and substantial either way, but the published rate numbers should be read as a slight over-estimate
until recomputed against critical path across a full campaign.

### 4.3a The thread-budget control — `unset` ≡ 16, and the OMP=2 cap costs nothing

Three conditions at cap 16 on one cell, conditions **rotated inside each replicate** so every
condition saw the same slice of the day, 3 reps
([`2026-08-21_h2h_thread_sweep.bash`](../util/ad-hoc/2026-08-21_h2h_thread_sweep.bash)):

| condition | candidate phase | candidate epochs | s / candidate epoch |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `unset` (shipped post-#533) | 1292.0 ± 178.4 s | 49,460 ± 3,851 | 0.02613 ± 0.00320 |
| explicit `16` (what #531 used) | 1436.7 ± 151.9 s | 53,500 ± 3,181 | 0.02693 ± 0.00340 |
| `2` (the pre-#533 cap) | 1316.3 ± 236.6 s | 49,550 ± 2,791 | 0.02644 ± 0.00328 |

Per-arm means carry ~12% cv purely from host drift, so the comparison is made **rep-paired** —
the rotation makes a replicate a valid pairing unit, the same argument as §2.2:

| rep-paired rate ratio vs `unset` | mean ± sd | 95% CI | |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| explicit `16` | 1.033 ± 0.095 | [0.926, 1.141] | includes 1.0 |
| `2` | 1.016 ± 0.116 | [0.885, 1.148] | includes 1.0 |

**`unset` is the same configuration as explicit 16.** That closes §3.2a's second candidate
explanation: this campaign and #531's probe were measuring the same thread budget, so the gap
between 1.706× and 1.17× is **sampling**, full stop.

**And the OMP=2 cap does not cost 1.30×.** juniper-cascor#531 attributed **1.30× of a 1.52×**
candidate-phase penalty to `main.py`'s pre-#533 cap, acting through throughput *and* epoch count.
Measured here: rate **1.016×**, work **1.002×** (49,460 vs 49,550 epochs) — a combined phase effect
of ~**1.018×**. The interval's upper bound is 1.148, so 1.30× is excluded; the data is consistent
with anything from 0.885 to 1.148, and n=3 cannot rule out a modest ~10% effect.

This is the **third** single-run attribution in this arc to fail under replication, and it explains
§3.3c: #533 did not move the cap-64 headline because there was little there to remove.

> **#533 is still the right change.** One BLAS policy called from both entry points is correct
> engineering whatever the number says, and it fixed a genuine asymmetry. What does not survive is

> the supersession banner this author added to the wide-budget note — needs the same correction.

### 4.3b Forked-worker profiling — the penalty is NOT in the workers' Python

Both arms run at cap 4 on one cell with the candidate-seed fix of §4.2 applied, so for the first time they train
**identical candidates**; every forked worker dumps a `cProfile` via
`JUNIPER_CASCOR_WORKER_PROFILE`. 32 profiles per arm — 4 rounds × 8 candidates, complete coverage.

| aggregate over all functions | service | CLI | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| total worker CPU (`tottime`) | 3782.1 s | 3994.1 s | 1.056 |
| total calls | 6.36 × 10⁹ | 7.12 × 10⁹ | 1.119 |
| **time per call** | 0.594 µs | 0.561 µs | **0.944** |

**Per-call cost is 0.944 — the CLI's workers are, if anything, marginally faster per call.** The
1.056× CPU difference is more than accounted for by 1.119× more *calls*. No function in the top 16
by time shows a CLI penalty that survives normalisation; even `torch.rand` is 0.899×.

And the same runs, compared like-for-like (both profiled):

| both under cProfile | service | CLI | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| candidate phase | 845.0 s | 749.0 s | 0.886 |
| candidate epochs | 13,140 | 11,310 | 0.861 |
| **s / candidate epoch** | 0.06431 | 0.06622 | **1.030** |

**Under profiling the rate penalty disappears** — 1.030 against 1.555 measured unprofiled at the
same cap.

That is not simply "a large constant overhead dilutes a ratio". If cProfile added a constant `C`
per epoch to both arms, the *absolute* gap would be preserved; it is not. Unprofiled, the arms
differ by **9.2 ms** per candidate epoch (0.0165 → 0.0257). Profiled, they differ by **1.9 ms**
(0.06431 → 0.06622). The penalty did not get diluted, it largely *went away*.

**Conclusion, stated as a negative result because that is what it is:** the ~1.33–1.55× per-epoch
penalty is **not** in the Python-level call structure or per-call cost of the candidate worker.
cProfile cannot see it and its overhead suppresses it, which rules out the whole class of
explanation this pass was built to test — and rules out cProfile as the instrument for the next
one. A sampling profiler (`py-spy`, not currently installed) or hardware counters would be needed,
because what is left is native execution time and wall-clock effects — BLAS internals, allocator
behaviour, memory locality, scheduling — that a deterministic Python profiler neither instruments
nor preserves.

> **n=1 per arm**, and the two legs still did different work (13,140 vs 11,310 epochs) despite the
> seed fix, because cascor#532 remains. The per-call figure is robust to that — it is normalised —
> but the wall figures in the second table are single runs.

### 4.3c What the profile *did* find: logging dominates worker CPU

Not what this pass was looking for, and worth more than what it was:

| function | calls (service / CLI) | µs/call |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `inspect.py:1004(getmodule)` | 5,466,060 / 4,727,550 | 237.89 / 293.30 |
| `builtins.hasattr` | 1.456 × 10⁹ / 1.663 × 10⁹ | 0.50 / 0.54 |
| `inspect.py:300(ismodule)` | 1.464 × 10⁹ / 1.670 × 10⁹ | 0.32 / 0.29 |
| `inspect.py:1670(getframeinfo)` | 4,790,881 / 4,143,561 | 10.29 / 9.81 |
| `inspect.py:1056(findsource)` | 4,790,881 / 4,143,561 | 6.96 / 6.59 |

`inspect`-based caller resolution and its `hasattr` / `ismodule` scanning account for roughly
**two thirds of profiled worker CPU**, and `getmodule` alone for about a third. Call *counts* are
not a cProfile artefact — cProfile inflates time, not call counts — so **1.46 billion `hasattr`
calls across 32 candidate trainings** is a real figure.

This is the custom `Logger` resolving each record's caller by walking the stack. It is equal on both
arms, so it explains nothing about the CLI-vs-service gap, but it is a large unconditional cost
inside the hottest loop in the system and it is worth its own issue independent of this
investigation.

### 4.3d Native profiling finds something larger than the gap: ~78% of worker CPU is logging

`py-spy record --native --subprocesses` on the service arm, 296,815 samples over the whole run.
Self time by frame:

| self frame | share |
| --- | ---: |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1024)` | **33.46%** |
| `_get_code_position (inspect.py:1668)` | 15.58% |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1023)` | 10.22% |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1026)` | 7.38% |
| `ismodule (inspect.py:302)` | 5.05% |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1025)` | 4.52% |
| `ismodule (inspect.py:300)` + `getframeinfo` | ~1.7% |
| **`inspect`-based caller resolution, total** | **≈ 78%** |

The candidate-training loop — the hottest code in the system — spends roughly **four fifths of its
CPU deciding which module each log record came from**, and under 2% in `libc` / `torch` frames.

This is not a profiler artefact. It reproduces the cProfile pass's independent finding (§4.3c,
`inspect` ≈ two thirds of profiled CPU, 1.46 × 10⁹ `hasattr` calls) using a *sampling native*
profiler with entirely different distortion characteristics.

#### The mechanism is a known CPython pathology, not merely "logging is slow"

`inspect.getmodule` keeps a `modulesbyfile` cache. On a miss it does this
(`inspect.py:1023`, the second-hottest line here):

```python
for modname, module in sys.modules.copy().items():
    if ismodule(module) and hasattr(module, '__file__'):
```

— it **copies the whole of `sys.modules` and scans it**, which is O(len(sys.modules)) per call and
allocates a dict of every loaded module each time. That is survivable if it populates the cache.

The trap is what happens when the scan finds *nothing* for that filename: `modulesbyfile` is never
updated for it, so the next call rescans, and every call after that. A single frame whose file is
not resolvable to a loaded module converts a cached lookup into an unbounded repeated full scan —
which is exactly the shape of a profile where six of the top seven frames are inside `getmodule`.

#### Why this matters more than the thing it was looking for

- It is **unconditional** — not a CLI-vs-service asymmetry, not a configuration, not opt-in. It is
  paid by every candidate epoch on **both** paths, including every campaign the service tier has
  ever run.
- It dwarfs the effect under investigation. The CLI-vs-service candidate-phase gap is 1.33–1.55×
  on the per-epoch term; this is ~78% of the per-epoch term itself, on both arms.
- It is plausibly cheap to fix — logging need not resolve a caller's module by scanning
  `sys.modules` at all — and a fix would benefit every consumer of cascor's trainer.

**This warrants its own cascor issue and should not be folded into the wall-gap work.** Recorded
here because this campaign is what found it; it is not a finding *about* the wall gap.

> **Caveat.** The share is measured on the SERVICE arm at cap 4 under `py-spy --native` at 100 Hz

> larger and the math per epoch is greater, is **not** established here.

### 4.4 ROOT CAUSE — the CLI's parent imports more modules, and logging scans them per record

The native profiler **preserves** the penalty where cProfile destroyed it: overall **1.600**
samples per candidate epoch (CLI / service), against the 1.555× measured unprofiled at this cap.
So for the first time the instrument and the effect agree, and the profile can be read.

| self frame | service s/ep | CLI s/ep | delta | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1024)` | 7.5579 | 13.5119 | **+5.9540** | 1.79 |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1023)` | 2.3080 | 4.3102 | **+2.0022** | 1.87 |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1026)` | 1.6671 | 2.8385 | +1.1714 | 1.70 |
| `_get_code_position (inspect.py:1668)` | 3.5185 | 4.1931 | +0.6746 | 1.19 |
| `ismodule (inspect.py:302)` | 1.1406 | 1.7317 | +0.5911 | 1.52 |
| `getmodule (inspect.py:1025)` | 1.0204 | 1.5568 | +0.5364 | 1.53 |
| `ismodule (inspect.py:300)` | 0.2702 | 0.4231 | +0.1528 | 1.57 |
| **`inspect` frames, summed** | | | **+11.08** | |
| *(total per-epoch gap)* | | | *+13.54* | |

**Those frames are 82% of the entire per-epoch penalty.** Everything else — `libc`, `libgomp`,
`gc_collect_main`, `__xstat64` — contributes under 1.5 samples/epoch combined. The gap is not BLAS,
not the allocator, not scheduling. It is `inspect.getmodule`.

#### Why `getmodule` is slower on one path

> **Correction (owner review).** An earlier version of this section said the workers are "forked, so
> each inherits its parent's `sys.modules` wholesale". **That is wrong.** Candidate workers are
> created from a **forkserver**, verified in source:
> `_PROJECT_MODEL_CANDIDATE_TRAINING_CONTEXT = "forkserver"`

> `start_method=forkserver`. A forkserver is a *fresh interpreter* spawned via `sys.executable` —
> not a fork of the launcher — so nothing is inherited "wholesale". The conclusion below survives;
> the mechanism had to be measured rather than assumed.

`getmodule`'s cache-miss path scans the whole module table (`inspect.py:1023`, §4.3d), so its cost
is **O(len(sys.modules))**. The question is therefore what module table a *worker* actually ends up
with. Measured inside the workers themselves, one line per process:

| | `len(sys.modules)` | heavy packages present |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| direct-CLI worker | **1,871** | matplotlib, **fastapi, pydantic**, torch |
| service worker | **1,410** | matplotlib, uvicorn, torch |
| **ratio** | **1.327×** | |

For reference, the launchers themselves are 1,867 (`import main`) and 1,416 (`import api.app`), and
a clean forkserver table is far smaller: the preload set alone is **1,091**, and adding
`cascade_correlation` — which every worker must import to unpickle its target — reaches **1,333**.

So the workers do **not** get the forkserver's small table; each ends up within a handful of modules
of its own launcher's. The forkserver is not delivering the isolation its use implies (§4.4a).

And the direct CLI's table is the larger one for a reason worth stating plainly: **`import main`
pulls in `fastapi` and `pydantic`** — verified directly — along with matplotlib. The direct CLI
never serves HTTP and never validates a request model; it is carrying the entire web/validation
stack into every candidate worker, and paying for it on every log record.

The corrected chain:

1. The CLI entry point's import graph is ~1.33× the service's, largely from `fastapi` / `pydantic` /
   `matplotlib` it does not use.
2. Workers end up with tables tracking their launcher (1,871 vs 1,410) despite the forkserver.
3. The logger resolves each record's caller with `inspect.getmodule`.
4. On a cache miss `getmodule` copies and scans `sys.modules` — O(n), so ~1.33× more work per call
   on the CLI.
5. That resolution is ~78% of worker CPU (§4.3d).
6. ⇒ the CLI's per-candidate-epoch cost is ~1.33× the service's, rising at small caps where logging
   is a larger share of the epoch.

#### The quantitative check this makes available

| quantity | value |
| --- | ---: |
| worker module-table ratio (CLI / service) | **1.327×** |
| measured per-epoch **rate** ratio at cap 64 | **1.331×** |

Those agree to **0.3%**. And the interpretation is specific rather than a coincidence to be admired:
the module-table ratio is the **floor** the rate ratio converges to as the cap grows and real
arithmetic crowds logging out of the epoch. At cap 16 the rate ratio is 1.415 and at cap 4 it is
1.555 — above the floor, by more the smaller the cap, exactly as the mechanism requires.

**Independent corroboration from the cProfile pass.** `getmodule` calls *per epoch* are equal —
5,466,060/13,140 = 416 on the service against 4,727,550/11,310 = 418 on the CLI — while cost *per
call* is 237.89 µs vs 293.30 µs, a ratio of **1.233**. Same number of calls, each more expensive:
exactly what an O(n) scan over a 1.319× larger table predicts, from an instrument that could not
see the effect end-to-end.

#### It also explains the cap series, which nothing else did

| cap | measured rate ratio |
| --- | ---: |
| 4 | 1.555 |
| 16 | 1.415 |
| 64 | 1.331 |

§3.3b recorded this monotonic *decline* as unexplained and warned against extrapolating through it.
It follows directly: logging cost per epoch is roughly fixed, while real arithmetic per epoch grows
with the cap as the candidate input widens. So logging's share of the epoch falls, and with it the
share of the epoch that carries the 1.32× penalty — driving the ratio toward 1. A mechanism that
predicts the *shape* of a curve it was not fitted to is the strongest evidence available here.

#### Honest limits

- **n=1 per arm.** The per-epoch ratio (1.600) is consistent with the k=4 unprofiled measurement
  (1.555 at this cap), which is the cross-check that matters, but the frame-level deltas are single
  runs.
- **1.319× module ratio against a 1.79× `getmodule` self-time ratio.** The direction and order of
  magnitude match and the cProfile per-call ratio (1.233) sits close to the module ratio, but the
  native self-time ratio is larger. Cache-miss *rate*, allocation cost of `sys.modules.copy()`, and
  memory locality could all contribute; **the residual above 1.32× is not accounted for here.**
- Measured at **cap 4**, where logging's share is largest. The mechanism predicts a smaller
  contribution at cap 64, consistent with the 1.331 there, but the frame-level profile at cap 64 was
  not taken.

### 4.4a The forkserver is used — but its preload set is mismatched to its job

The architecture is intact. `_init_multiprocessing` resolves
`candidate_training_context_type` → `"forkserver"` and calls `set_forkserver_preload`
(`cascade_correlation.py:1063–1079`); the persistent pool creates every worker with
`self._mp_ctx.Process` (`:3772`); workers self-report `start_method=forkserver`.

> Worth tidying while here: `:1061–1062` still carries a commented-out
> `self._mp_ctx = mp.get_context("forkserver")` above a garbled note —
> *"This is unnecessary: Changing Context type did not corrUse 'fork' context for better
> compatibility with BaseManager on Linux"* — which reads as though the code uses `fork`. It does
> not. A reader checking this exact question is actively misled.

#### What the preload set costs and what it buys

Preloaded: `["os", "uuid", "torch", "numpy", "random", "logging", "datetime"]`. Marginal cost of
each, measured (bare interpreter = 77 modules):

| entry | + modules | import time | assessment |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `os` | 0 | 0.000 s | already imported by the interpreter — a no-op |
| `uuid` | 2 | 0.001 s | negligible |
| `random` | 5 | 0.006 s | negligible |
| `logging` | 10 | 0.013 s | negligible |
| `datetime` | 2 | 0.001 s | negligible |
| `numpy` | 109 | 0.153 s | worth preloading |
| **`torch`** | **886** | **2.938 s** | the entire point of the mechanism |
| **total** | **1,014** | **~3.11 s** | |

`torch` and `numpy` are **98% of the modules and 99% of the time**. The other five together are 19
modules and 21 ms — they neither help nor hurt, but they suggest the list was written for
plausibility rather than measured.

**What is missing is the expensive part.** Every worker must import `cascade_correlation` to
unpickle its target, and that import is **242 modules and 1.822 s** (and is what drags in
matplotlib). It is *not* preloaded, so it is paid **after** the fork, in each worker
independently:

- **~12.8 s of duplicated CPU per pool creation** (7 workers × 1.82 s), on every `fit()`.
- **242 modules × 7 of duplicated memory**, where preloading would have made them copy-on-write
  shared from a single forkserver copy.
- And it inflates each worker's `sys.modules`, which is the O(n) term in §4.4.

Preloading it would move that import into the forkserver once. **One correctness precondition
before that becomes a recommendation:** preloading executes the module's import-time side effects
*in the forkserver*, and every worker then inherits them across a fork. Logger handles, file
descriptors, or any resource opened at import would be shared rather than per-worker — the classic
fork-safety hazard, and the reason a preload list is not simply "add everything". That audit is not
done here.

#### The forkserver is not currently buying the isolation it implies

The measurements in §4.4 show workers ending up within a handful of modules of their launcher
(1,871 vs 1,867; 1,410 vs 1,416) rather than near the forkserver's own 1,091–1,333. Whatever path
carries the launcher's import graph into the workers, the practical effect is that **the entry
point's imports reach the candidate workers anyway** — which is why `main.py` importing `fastapi`
and `pydantic` costs real time in a training loop that never serves a request.

Tracing the precise import route is **not** done here and is the obvious next question for anyone
acting on this section.

### 4.5 Remaining hypotheses

With packing eliminated (§4.3) and thread context eliminated (§4.1), what is left for the ~1.33×
per-epoch penalty is the **worker environment**: the candidate workers are forked from a
`uvicorn` parent on one path and a bare `python main.py` parent on the other. Forkserver preload
set, allocator state, copy-on-write layout and inherited interpreter state all differ, and none of
them are visible from the logs.

That is what the profiling pass in §4.3b/§4.4 had to discriminate, and it is now correctly aimed: a per-epoch
cost difference inside the worker, not a scheduling or ordering effect.

---

## 5. Impact

### 5.1 No campaign workload is affected — the framework never uses the CLI path

`run_experiment.py` drives training entirely through the service REST API
(`POST /v1/training/dataset`, `POST /v1/training/start`) and **never invokes `main.py`**. Every
suite, every campaign, and every PF suite therefore runs the **service** tier — the arm measured at
0/190 divergence and the faster of the two.

So the headline is narrower than it sounds: **a ~1.9× gap on a path nothing in the experiment
framework executes.** No campaign is silently paying it.

### 5.2 Where it does bite: the perf lane cannot share a baseline across tiers

The §12 plan reuses cascor's `--profile` / `--profile-memory` entry points and shows them driven as

```bash
JUNIPER_DATA_URL=… python main.py --profile --profile-output "$RUN_DIR/profiles"
```

— i.e. the **direct CLI** — while its PF-1…PF-6 scenario suites run through the driver, i.e. the
**service**. Those two tiers differ by ~1.9× in candidate-phase wall at cap 64 and ~1.7× at cap 16.

**Consequence for P3, stated as a constraint rather than a suggestion:** a regression threshold
calibrated on one tier and applied to the other is wrong by 70–90% before any regression exists.
Either the lane measures one tier, or it keeps **two** baselines and never compares across them.
This is the concrete answer to the handoff's question of whether CLI and service numbers can share
a baseline: **they cannot.**

### 5.3 Sizing it where the caps are actually used

Per *pair* of runs at the caps this program uses, measured, on a quiet host:

| cap | service | direct CLI | extra CLI wall |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 16 | ~827 s | ~1421 s | **+594 s** (+10 min) |
| 64 | ~2522 s | ~4859 s | **+2337 s** (+39 min) |

A cap-64 CLI run costs about **40 minutes more** than the same work through the service. For a
campaign of a dozen cap-64 cells that is ~8 hours — real, but only payable by someone deliberately
running the CLI path.

### 5.4 The part that is not a performance cost at all

Roughly **half** the cap-64 gap is the work term (1.454×), and that term is
[cascor#532](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/issues/532) — the CLI doing a variable
amount of extra candidate training because its trajectory diverges. Its own spread is 0.913×–1.680×
across four pairs on identical configuration.

That is not throughput and no scheduler or runtime fix will touch it. It shrinks only when the CLI
path becomes reproducible, and part of it is not even nondeterminism but the seed-derivation defect
in §4.2 — which is fixed and verified there.

### 5.5 Operational: cap-64 evidence is expensive to keep, not just to produce

A single cap-64 CLI leg writes a **637 MB** trainer log; the four-pair campaign wrote ~5 GB, and the
experiment state directory now holds **38 GB**. Analysis is correspondingly slow — parsing one
campaign takes minutes, which is why the readers here stream rather than slurp.

This is a real constraint on `k` independent of wall-clock: a k=37 campaign at cap 64 (what a 0.05
half-width on the span would need) would produce ~46 GB of logs. It is another reason the **rate**
term — sufficient at k=4 — is the right thing to track.

---

## 6. Honest limits

Ordered by how much they constrain the headline.

**1. The rate figures are measured against the wrong denominator, and are ~4.5% too high.**
`s / candidate epoch` divides the candidate-phase wall by TOTAL epochs, but a round's wall is set by
the busiest worker's critical path (8 candidates over 7 workers). §4.3 measured the correct
denominator at 1.297× against the 1.241× the rate column uses. Applied to cap 16, **1.415× should be
read as ≈1.354×**; cap 64's 1.331× shifts similarly. The direction of every conclusion is unchanged
— and the ratio is what matters, not the absolute — but the published rate numbers are a slight
over-estimate **until recomputed against critical path across a full campaign**. That recomputation
is not done. The imbalance figures themselves are n=1 per arm.

**2. Frame-level profiling is n=1 per arm.** §4.3b/§4.4's per-call and per-frame deltas come from one
run each. The per-epoch ratio they produce (1.600) is corroborated by the k=4 unprofiled measurement
(1.555 at that cap), which is the cross-check that matters, but no frame-level figure has an
interval.

**3. The 1.327× module-table ratio does not fully account for the 1.79× `getmodule` self-time
ratio.** Direction and order of magnitude match, and the cProfile per-call ratio (1.233×) sits close
to the module ratio — but the residual above 1.32× is **not explained**. Cache-miss rate, the cost of
`sys.modules.copy()` itself, and memory locality are all candidates; none was isolated.

**4. The `~78% of worker CPU is logging` share is measured on the SERVICE arm at cap 4**, where
logging's share of an epoch is largest. The mechanism predicts a smaller share at cap 64 (consistent
with the rate ratio falling to 1.331 there), but the frame-level profile at cap 64 was not taken.

**5. The forkserver's isolation gap is observed, not traced.** Workers carry 1,871 / 1,410 modules
against a clean forkserver table of 1,091–1,333 (§4.4a §6.1). *That* they inherit their launcher's
import graph is measured; *how* is not.

**6. `k` is bounded by evidence volume, not only by wall clock.** A cap-64 CLI leg writes a 637 MB
trainer log. The k=37 that a 0.05 half-width on the span would need is ~46 GB of logs before any
compute argument.

**7. Everything here is pre-F1.** The cap series and every ratio in §3 were measured on cascor
`362b88b`, before the logging fix. See §8.

**§4.3 (re-measure), §4.4 (root cause), §4.5 (impact) and §4.6 (fix) are all CLOSED.** The fix is
[juniper-cascor#563](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/pull/563), designed in
[`JUNIPER_2026-08-23_…LOGGING-PATHOLOGY-FIX-DESIGN.md`](JUNIPER_2026-08-23_JUNIPER-CASCOR_CANDIDATE-WORKER-LOGGING-PATHOLOGY-FIX-DESIGN.md).

| deliverable | outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 5A — cap-64 ratio on post-#533 main | **1.924 ± 0.486**, k=4 paired, cascor `362b88b` |
| 5B — root cause | **identified**: `inspect.getmodule` scanning `sys.modules` per log record |
| 5C — impact | no campaign workload affected; the perf lane **cannot share a baseline** across tiers |
| 5D — fix | cascor#563 — ~9× faster training on **both** arms; per-epoch penalty no longer demonstrable |

### 8.1 What the fix did and did not do

**Did**: the per-candidate-epoch rate ratio falls **1.415 → 1.065** [0.869, 1.262] at cap 16 k=4 —
the interval now includes 1.0, so no throughput penalty is demonstrable. Absolute wall fell **827 s →
89 s** (service) and **1434 s → 162 s** (CLI).

**Did not**: the **span** ratio did not improve (1.735 → **1.817**). Before F1 the candidate phase
was 98% of the service's span; after, 66%. Removing the dominant cost promoted fixed per-run
overhead — startup, dataset fetch, output passes, teardown — which F1 never touched. The span ratio
now measures a different thing, and comparing it to the pre-F1 number is a mistake.

**Did not**: the residual candidate-phase ratio (1.308, CI [1.083, 1.532]) is the **work** term
(1.230), which is [cascor#532](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/issues/532) and untouched
by any logging change.

### 8.2 Carried forward

- **Every ratio in this document is pre-F1** and is now historical. Re-measuring the cap series is
  cheap post-fix (runs are ~9× shorter) and is not done.
- **Two rows of the fix design's verification plan were not executed**: the post-fix worker profile
  (`inspect` frames should fall from ~78% to negligible) and — more importantly — the
  **determinism-unchanged** check. F1 changes what is computed per log record, not the arithmetic,
  so the divergence rate must be unchanged; that has **not been confirmed**.
- **F2** (CLI import hygiene) and **F3** (forkserver preload, blocked on a fork-safety audit) are
  designed and unstarted. **§4.4a §6.1's forkserver-isolation question** may subsume F2.
- The **per-run fixed overhead** exposed by §8.1 is a new target with no instrument — the existing
  phase split separates candidate from output only.

### 8.3 Teardown attestation

Checked after the last arm, with `util/experiment_stack.bash --down <RUN_ID>` run for every stack:

| check | result |
| --- | --- |
| listeners on 8110–8139 / 8230–8259 / 8260–8289 | **0** |
| port lockdirs in `/run/user/1000/juniper-experiments` | **0** |
| `artifacts/` preserved | yes — teardown reports "never deleted" |

> Concurrent sessions share these ranges. A non-zero count is not necessarily this arc's leak;
> `util/experiment_stack.bash --status` lists every run before assuming ownership.
