## 1. Prerequisites

### Tools

Install the build and upload toolchain:

```bash
pip install build twine
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `build` | PEP 517 frontend — builds sdist and wheel from `pyproject.toml` |
| `twine` | Uploads distributions to PyPI/TestPyPI and validates package metadata |

### Accounts

- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/account/register/
- **TestPyPI**: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/

These are separate registries with separate accounts. Register on both.

### API Tokens (for manual uploads)

On each registry, go to **Account Settings > API tokens** and create a token:

- **Scope**: Project-scoped tokens are preferred over account-wide tokens. For a first upload (before the project exists on PyPI), you must use an account-wide token, then replace it with a project-scoped token afterward.
- **Storage**: Save tokens in `~/.pypirc`:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Set restrictive permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
```

> **Note**: If using GitHub Actions with trusted publishing (OIDC), API tokens are not needed for CI uploads. See [Section 10](#10-automating-with-github-actions-trusted-publishing).

## 2. Project Structure and Metadata

### Minimum required files

```
juniper/
├── pyproject.toml    # Package metadata, build system, dependencies
├── README.md         # Long description (rendered on PyPI project page)
└── LICENSE           # License file
```

### pyproject.toml — the single source of truth

The `juniper-ml` package uses `setuptools` as the build backend. Here is its `pyproject.toml` annotated with key fields:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]    # Build dependencies
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"      # PEP 517 backend

[project]
name = "juniper-ml"                          # PyPI package name (must be globally unique)
version = "0.1.0"                            # SemVer — bump this before each release
description = "Juniper - Cascade Correlation Neural Network Research Platform"
readme = "README.md"                         # Rendered as the PyPI long description
license = "MIT"
authors = [{ name = "Paul Calnon" }]
requires-python = ">=3.12"
keywords = ["juniper", "cascade-correlation", "neural-network", "machine-learning"]
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    # ... additional classifiers
]
dependencies = []                            # Runtime deps (empty for a meta-package)

[project.optional-dependencies]              # pip install juniper-ml[clients]
clients = [
    "juniper-data-client>=0.3.0",
    "juniper-cascor-client>=0.1.0",
]
worker = [
    "juniper-cascor-worker>=0.1.0",
]
all = [
    "juniper[clients,worker]",               # Composite extra
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-ml"
Repository = "https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-ml"
Issues = "https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-ml/issues"
```

### Key metadata decisions

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| `name` | Must be unique on PyPI. Normalized: underscores, hyphens, and periods are equivalent (`juniper-ml` == `juniper_ml`). Check availability at `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`. |
| `version` | Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Must be incremented for every upload — PyPI will reject a version that already exists, even if the prior upload was deleted. |
| `readme` | Supports Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`). PyPI renders this as the project landing page. |
| `classifiers` | Selected from the [official list](https://pypi.org/classifiers/). Helps users discover your package. |
| `requires-python` | Enforced at install time. Users on unsupported Python versions will get an error or receive an older compatible version. |

## 3. PyPI and TestPyPI Account Setup

### 3.1 Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

PyPI requires 2FA for all accounts. Enable it under **Account Settings > Two factor authentication** using a TOTP app or hardware security key.

### 3.2 Create the project (first upload)

The project is automatically created on PyPI/TestPyPI the first time you upload a distribution with that package name. There is no separate "create project" step.

### 3.3 Configure trusted publishing (for GitHub Actions)

If you plan to automate publishing via GitHub Actions (recommended), configure trusted publishing **before your first automated upload**:

1. Go to **PyPI > Your Projects > (project name) > Settings > Publishing** (or for a new project: **Account Settings > Publishing > Add a new pending publisher**)
2. Fill in:
   - **Owner**: Your GitHub username or organization (e.g., `pcalnon`)
   - **Repository**: The repo name (e.g., `juniper`)
   - **Workflow name**: The filename of the workflow (e.g., `publish.yml`)
   - **Environment name**: The GitHub Actions environment (e.g., `pypi` or `testpypi`)
3. Repeat for TestPyPI if you use it as a staging step.

This eliminates the need for API tokens in CI. The workflow authenticates via OIDC.

---

## 4. Building the Package Locally

From the project root (where `pyproject.toml` lives):

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Build both sdist (.tar.gz) and wheel (.whl)
python -m build
```

This produces files in `dist/`:

```
dist/
├── juniper_ml-0.1.0.tar.gz       # Source distribution
└── juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl  # Built distribution (wheel)
```

### What gets built

| Artifact | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| sdist | `.tar.gz` | Source archive — includes `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and any source code |
| wheel | `.whl` | Pre-built distribution — faster to install, no build step required at install time |

### Build tags explained

The wheel filename `juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` encodes compatibility:

- `py3` — Python 3 only
- `none` — No ABI dependency (pure Python)
- `any` — Platform-independent

---

## 5. Validating the Package

### 5.1 Check metadata and rendering

```bash
twine check dist/*
```

This validates:
- Package metadata is well-formed
- `README.md` renders correctly (catches Markdown/RST issues that would break the PyPI page)

Expected output:

```
Checking dist/juniper_ml-0.1.0.tar.gz: PASSED
Checking dist/juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl: PASSED
```

### 5.2 Inspect the wheel contents

```bash
unzip -l dist/juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Verify it contains the expected files (metadata, license, readme) and nothing unexpected (stray test files, `.env` files, etc.).

### 5.3 Test a local install

```bash
# Create an isolated venv
python -m venv /tmp/test-install
source /tmp/test-install/bin/activate

# Install from the built wheel
pip install dist/juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Verify
pip show juniper-ml

# Clean up
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-install
```

---

## 6. Publishing to TestPyPI (Manual)

TestPyPI is a staging environment that mirrors PyPI. Always upload here first.

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

If not using `~/.pypirc`, you can pass credentials inline:

```bash
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ \
    --username __token__ \
    --password pypi-YOUR_TESTPYPI_TOKEN \
    dist/*
```

Expected output:

```
Uploading juniper_ml-0.1.0.tar.gz
Uploading juniper_ml-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
View at: https://test.pypi.org/project/juniper-ml/0.1.0/
```

---

## 7. Verifying the TestPyPI Upload

### 7.1 Check the project page

Visit `https://test.pypi.org/project/juniper-ml/0.1.0/` and verify:
- Description renders correctly
- Metadata (author, license, classifiers) is correct
- Project links work

### 7.2 Test installation from TestPyPI

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/test-testpypi
source /tmp/test-testpypi/bin/activate

# --extra-index-url ensures real dependencies resolve from PyPI
pip install \
    --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
    juniper-ml==0.1.0

pip show juniper-ml

deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-testpypi
```

> **Important**: The `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` flag is essential. TestPyPI does not host all packages — without this fallback, dependencies will fail to resolve.

> **2026-08-08 amendment — the CI meta-verify no longer uses the merged-index form above (owner-approved two-phase mechanism)**: pip has **no index priority**, so `--index-url` + `--extra-index-url` collapse into ONE namespace where the *highest version across both indexes wins* — a dependency-confusion vector in which a TestPyPI squatter outranks the real package (live failure: TestPyPI `fastapi 1.0`, a broken sdist, beat production `fastapi 0.141.1` and killed the juniper-ml v0.7.0 verify, run 31281873275). `.github/workflows/publish.yml` now verifies in two phases — **(1) provenance**: `pip download --no-deps --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --dest <tmp> "juniper-ml==${VERSION}"` (TestPyPI only, exact version), then **(2) resolution**: `pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ "<wheel>[extra]"` (production PyPI only, no `--no-deps`, so extras resolution is still genuinely exercised). The one-index-at-a-time rule is the point; the manual recipe above remains merged-namespace and is therefore subject to the same squatting risk. Gate: `tests/test_publish_testpypi_verify.py`.

---

## 8. Publishing to PyPI (Manual)

Once TestPyPI is verified:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

> **This is irreversible for the version number.** Once `0.1.0` is uploaded and then deleted, you can never upload `0.1.0` again. You would need to bump to `0.1.1`.

---

## 9. Verifying the PyPI Upload

### 9.1 Check the project page

Visit `https://pypi.org/project/juniper-ml/0.1.0/`.

### 9.2 Test installation from PyPI

```bash
python -m venv /tmp/test-pypi
source /tmp/test-pypi/bin/activate

pip install juniper-ml==0.1.0
pip show juniper-ml

# Test optional extras
pip install "juniper-ml[all]==0.1.0"

deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-pypi
```

---

## 10. Automating with GitHub Actions (Trusted Publishing)

Manual uploads work but are error-prone and non-auditable. The recommended approach is CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions with trusted publishing (OIDC).

### 10.1 How trusted publishing works

Instead of storing API tokens as GitHub secrets, PyPI verifies the identity of the GitHub Actions workflow itself via OpenID Connect (OIDC). The workflow requests a short-lived token from PyPI, scoped to the specific project and environment.

Requirements:
- The GitHub repository must be registered as a trusted publisher on PyPI (see [Section 3.3](#33-configure-trusted-publishing-for-github-actions))
- The workflow must have `id-token: write` permission
- The workflow must use a named GitHub environment matching the one registered on PyPI

### 10.2 Workflow file

The `juniper-ml` project uses `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. The YAML below is the **original simplified design**, not the live workflow — see the 2026-08-08 and 2026-08-24 amendments after §10.3. Live contract: [`docs/REFERENCE.md` § Meta-Package Publish Pipeline](../docs/REFERENCE.md#meta-package-publish-pipeline).

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]              # Triggered by creating a GitHub Release

permissions:
  id-token: write                   # Required for OIDC trusted publishing

jobs:
  testpypi:
    name: Publish to TestPyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: testpypi           # Must match the TestPyPI trusted publisher config
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      - name: Install build tools
        run: pip install build twine

      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build

      - name: Check package
        run: twine check dist/*

      - name: Publish to TestPyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

      - name: Verify TestPyPI install
        run: |
          VERSION="${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"
          VERSION="${VERSION#v}"      # Strip leading 'v' (v0.1.0 -> 0.1.0)
          sleep 30                    # Wait for TestPyPI index to update
          pip install \
              --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
              --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
              juniper-ml==${VERSION}

  pypi:
    name: Publish to PyPI
    needs: testpypi                  # Only runs if TestPyPI succeeds
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: pypi                # Must match the PyPI trusted publisher config
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      - name: Install build tools
        run: pip install build twine

      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build

      - name: Check package
        run: twine check dist/*

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

### 10.3 Key design decisions in this workflow

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| TestPyPI runs first, PyPI depends on it (`needs: testpypi`) | Catches packaging errors before the irreversible PyPI upload |
| Verification step installs from TestPyPI after upload | Confirms the package is actually installable, not just uploadable |
| `sleep 30` before verification install | **Historical.** TestPyPI index propagation can lag. Live `publish.yml` (juniper-ml#1310) replaced this with a bounded 10×6s `pip download` poll (~60s ceiling); do not restore the fixed sleep. |
| Separate GitHub environments (`testpypi`, `pypi`) | Each maps to its own trusted publisher configuration; enables environment-level protection rules (e.g., manual approval for `pypi`) |
| Rebuild in the `pypi` job instead of passing artifacts | **Historical.** Live workflows upload a `dist/` artifact from `build` and download it in the publish jobs. |
| `id-token: write` at the top level | **Historical.** P4 (juniper-ml#357) scopes `id-token: write` to the two publish jobs only; the build job restates `contents: read`. |

> **2026-08-24 amendment (juniper-ml#1310).** Two live-workflow corrections against the snippet above.
>
> 1. **Bounded poll, not `sleep 30`.** TestPyPI's simple index is CDN-fronted and lags ~5–30s, so the first fetch of a just-published version can 404. A fixed sleep is wrong in both directions: paid in full when the index is already warm (77% of a measured 39s step), and still a coin-flip when propagation runs long. Live Gate 1 polls `pip download --no-deps` from TestPyPI-only, 10 attempts × 6s (~60s ceiling), then a real `::error::` if the version is never served. The fetch stays on one parseable line (`tests/test_publish_testpypi_verify.py` matches `^pip download`). Sibling publishers retry `pip install --no-deps` five times with a 10s interval.
> 2. **The trigger is the gate.** The six sub-package publishers used to carry a `Require a GitHub Release for this tag` step gated on `if: github.event_name == 'push'`. None of them subscribe to `push:` (removed after #555, where Release-plus-push raced the immutable TestPyPI upload), so those steps could never run. Dead code shaped like a guard is worse than no guard. With `release: published` as the only automatic trigger, a bare `git push <tag>` starts **no run**. Gate: `tests/test_publish_release_only_trigger.py` (glob-discovered; pins both directions). Re-measured 2026-08-24: 12 tags exist with no Release and none of them published.

### 10.4 GitHub environment setup

Create two environments in **GitHub > Repository > Settings > Environments**:

1. **`testpypi`**
   - No special protection rules needed
   - Used for staging uploads

2. **`pypi`**
   - Recommended: Add a **required reviewer** protection rule so production publishes require manual approval
   - Optional: Restrict to the `main` branch

---

## 11. Cutting a Release (End-to-End)

This is the complete procedure from "code is ready" to "package is live on PyPI."

> **Release convention (mandatory).** Every PyPI deploy — the meta-package **and** every shared /
> sub-package — is performed by **cutting a GitHub Release**, never by pushing a bare tag, and the
> release notes are **archived under `notes/releases/`**. The Release (and its archived notes) is the
> durable, auditable record of the deploy; the tag the Release creates is what triggers the publish
> workflow. This convention drifted during rapid concurrent development (several sub-packages shipped
> tag-only, with no Release and no archived notes) and is being restored — see §11.3–§11.4.

### 11.1 Bump the version

Edit `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
version = "0.2.0"    # was "0.1.0"
```

### 11.2 Commit and push

```bash
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.2.0"
git push origin main
```

### 11.3 Author and archive the release notes

Write the notes from [`notes/templates/TEMPLATE_RELEASE_NOTES.md`](templates/TEMPLATE_RELEASE_NOTES.md)
and **archive a copy in the central `juniper-ml/notes/releases/` archive** (committed in the release
PR) so every ecosystem release has one in-repo record alongside its GitHub Release body. The archive
is **central**: releases cut from *other* repos (e.g. juniper-recurrence, juniper-cascor) are archived
here too, not in their own repos.

- Meta-package (`juniper-ml`): `RELEASE_NOTES_v<version>.md`
- Every other package — a shared sub-package *or* a package from another repo: `RELEASE_NOTES_<pkg>_v<version>.md`
  (e.g. `RELEASE_NOTES_juniper-model-core_v0.2.0.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_juniper-cascor_v0.5.0.md`). The
  package prefix is required so same-version tags across packages (e.g. juniper-ml `v0.5.0` vs
  juniper-cascor `v0.5.0`) never collide.

### 11.4 Cut the GitHub Release (this is the deploy — never a bare tag)

Cutting the Release is what creates the tag and triggers the publish workflow. **Do not
`git push <tag>` by hand** — always go through a Release so the deploy has a durable, auditable
record. For the meta-package the Release event triggers `publish.yml`; for a shared / sub-package the
Release **creates the `juniper-<pkg>-v*` tag**, which triggers that package's `publish-<pkg>.yml`.

#### Option A: GitHub CLI

```bash
# Meta-package (tag v<version>):
gh release create v0.2.0 --title "v0.2.0" \
    --notes-file notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.2.0.md --latest

# Shared / sub-package (tag juniper-<pkg>-v<version>); --latest=false keeps the meta-package's badge:
gh release create juniper-model-core-v0.2.0 \
    --title "juniper-model-core v0.2.0 — <headline>" \
    --notes-file notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_juniper-model-core_v0.2.0.md --latest=false
```

#### Option B: GitHub Web UI

1. Go to **Releases > Draft a new release**
2. **Create** the tag inline — `v<version>` (meta) or `juniper-<pkg>-v<version>` (sub-package)
3. Set the title and paste the archived release notes
4. Click **Publish release**

### 11.5 Monitor the workflow

```bash
gh run list --workflow=publish.yml --limit=1
gh run watch                       # Live tail the run
```

Or visit **Actions** tab in the repository.

### 11.6 Verify

```bash
pip install juniper-ml==0.2.0
pip show juniper-ml
```

### 11.7 The release-train ceremony (the automated path), and what it cannot check

§11.1–§11.6 describe the manual path. Most releases now go through `util/release_train/` instead,
which keeps both gates with the owner and automates only the middle:

- **Gate 1**: the version bump and the CHANGELOG's `## [<version>]` section ride an owner-approved PR.
- **The middle**: `ceremony.py` authors the notes, opens the central archive PR, cuts the Release, and
  parks at the `pypi` environment.
- **Gate 2**: the PyPI deploy waits there for its reviewer.

**Run it from a clean checkout at `origin/main`.** The ceremony reads the CHANGELOG, and its own code,
from `--repo-root`, not from GitHub. A working tree carrying stale or unmerged files renders the
permanent notes from text and code that are not on `main`.

```bash
ECO=/home/pcalnon/Development/python/Juniper
python3 util/release_train/detect.py --repo-root . --ecosystem-root "$ECO" --package <pkg> --json > manifest.json
python3 util/release_train/ceremony.py --manifest manifest.json --package <pkg> --repo-root . --ecosystem-root "$ECO" --dry-run
python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-09-12_ceremony_notes_preview.py --package <pkg> --version <new> \
    --released-version <previous> --release-date <UTC date> --repo-root . --ecosystem-root "$ECO"
python3 util/release_train/ceremony.py --manifest manifest.json --package <pkg> --repo-root . --ecosystem-root "$ECO" --execute
```

Notes on those commands:

- `--manifest` is required.
- `--dry-run` is the default, and it overrides `--execute`.
- Add `--cross-repo` for a package owned by a sibling repo. Its Release is cut there, while the
  archive PR still lands centrally in juniper-ml.
- `detect.py` exits 1 whenever anything needs a release. That is its normal answer, not a failure.
- The ceremony HALTs, correctly, if `main`'s latest CI run is not green.
- **Pass `--target-sha <full 40-char sha>` whenever anything can merge between the preview and the
  cut.** Without it, the Release tags the owning repo's `main` as it is at cut time, while the notes
  come from the checkout. Those are two trees, and they agree only if nothing merged in between. With
  it, the tag lands on that commit, and the CI precondition reads that commit's own run instead of
  `main`'s newest. The checkout must be of the same commit: for a sibling, extract
  `gh api repos/pcalnon/<repo>/tarball/<sha>`. It needs exactly one `--package`, and it refuses an
  abbreviated sha, which `gh` would reject only after the archive PR was armed. Added 2026-09-24,
  after three juniper-data PRs merged between the owner's approval of the 0.16.0 notes (pinned at
  `7125e161`) and the cut. One of them left a duplicate `## [0.16.0]` heading, which would have
  published only its own bullets.
- **`.github/workflows/release-train.yml` also runs on a daily cron (13:00 UTC), but it cannot cut
  a Release unless told to.** Its mode resolves as the dispatch input, then the repo variable
  `RELEASE_TRAIN_MODE`, then `report`. With the variable unset, as it was on 2026-09-23, a scheduled
  run is detection only: its proposal and ceremony jobs show as *skipped*. So a pending manual cut
  is not racing the cron. Check the variable before assuming this still holds.

**A Release body cannot be re-cut.** `ceremony.py` renders both the Release body and the archived
`notes/releases/` file from the CHANGELOG's `## [<version>]` section, and nothing checks that the
section describes the release. `--dry-run --json` lists the planned actions but omits the rendered
notes, so read them with the preview script before `--execute`.

Five shapes have reached, or nearly reached, that artifact. Rows 1–4 are from the juniper-ml 0.9.0
and juniper-data 0.15.0 releases (2026-09-22); row 5 is from the juniper-ml 0.10.0 pre-flight
(2026-09-23). The causes are unrelated, so no single control catches them all:

| # | what happened | control |

| 1 | An ad-hoc CHANGELOG editor partitioned on the rest of the file rather than the `[Unreleased]` slice. Its `### Changed` search matched a heading inside the already-released `## [0.8.0]`, so the 0.9.0 notes would have omitted the release's whole point. | Bound every scripted CHANGELOG edit to its section and assert the anchor exactly. `util/ad-hoc/2026-09-22_raise_data_floor_0_15_0.py` refuses to open a release section unless `[Unreleased]` is empty. Then preview. |
| 2 | Three image changes merged with no CHANGELOG entry (juniper-data #405, #408, #392/#394). A juniper-data Release mints a container image as well as a wheel. | Diff the tag window against the section. The preview shows only what is *in* the CHANGELOG, so it cannot see this. |
| 3 | `notes_render.py` derived "Breaking changes" from `### Removed` alone. juniper-data 0.15.0 would have published "Breaking changes: NO" directly above a `BREAKING (contract)` bullet. | Fixed in the renderer; the recognised markers are listed below. Read the Release Summary in the preview. |
| 4 | A PR merged between the bump PR and `--execute` and filed its entry under `[Unreleased]`. A Release tags the branch **head**, so its code shipped in a release whose notes did not mention it (juniper-data#418, folded in by #419). | Re-check the tag window **immediately** before `--execute`. |
| 5 | A PR authored against `[Unreleased]` merged 22 minutes **after** a release that had turned that slot into `## [0.9.0]`, and the squash filed four bullets under the **released** heading with no conflict (juniper-ml#2002). | Before cutting, check the **previous** release's section against its archive (below), then re-home what it lists (juniper-ml#2049). |

The tag-window check (controls 2 and 4):

```bash
git log --oneline <last-tag>..origin/main                                     # every commit the tag will carry
sed -n '/^## \[<version>\]/,/^## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | grep -oE '#[0-9]{3,4}' | sort -u   # every PR the notes name
```

The released-section check (control 5) lists every bullet in the previous release's section that its Release
never said. juniper-ml's `[0.9.0]` carried four such bullets (4 of 22):

```bash
python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-09-23_released_section_drift.py --changelog CHANGELOG.md \
    --archive notes/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v<previous>.md --version <previous>
```

**Date the release section in UTC.** The ceremony stamps the notes with today's UTC date
(`ceremony._today`), and the `Verify AGENTS.md Last Updated` gate compares against UTC too. A section
dated in local time near midnight UTC disagrees with the body rendered from it.

**The Latest badge follows the registry.** Each repo has exactly one package marked `latest: true` in
`util/release_train/registry.yaml`. That is its `v*`-tagged package, or juniper-recurrence's app, which
has no `v*` tag. The ceremony cuts that package with `--latest` and every other with `--latest=false`,
which is §11.4's rule. Until 2026-09-23 it passed `--latest=false` on every cut, the meta-package's
included. Six repos' badges had fallen behind their newest release, juniper-ml's own among them
(v0.6.0 against v0.10.0). They were moved by hand that day, on the owner's approval. Moving a badge
(`gh release edit <tag> --latest`) fires nothing: every release-triggered workflow in the nine repos
subscribes to `published` only (`util/ad-hoc/2026-09-23_release_trigger_types_census.py`, 24 workflows).

**What the renderer counts as breaking** (`notes_render._is_breaking`):

- a `### Removed` section, or a heading whose category word is `Breaking`;
- a heading qualifier that says breaking, in any case, e.g. `### Changed (potentially breaking)`;
- a bullet or sub-bullet that *opens* with `Breaking change(s)`, in any case and optionally bold;
- an uppercase `BREAKING` anywhere in a bullet.

`non-`, `not` or `no` directly before the word negates it. Lowercase mid-sentence prose is
deliberately not a marker, because it is usually a denial ("this is not a breaking change").

**Gate 2 belongs to the owner.** `PENDING_PYPI_APPROVAL` is the ceremony's success state.
`current_user_can_approve` reads `true` for an agent's token, and an agent approving anyway defeats the
gate's entire purpose. Hand the owner the run URL and stop.

**Verify from the registry, not from a tally.** Use the version-specific endpoint
(`/pypi/<pkg>/<version>/json` returns 200), because the aggregate endpoint lags behind the CDN. For a
package that also publishes an image, check the registry's tag list as well. "I merged the bump" and
"it is on PyPI" are separated by a ceremony that is easy to skip. juniper-model-core 0.3.2 sat bumped
and unreleased until a final registry sweep caught it
(`notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-30_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PARTITION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` §10).

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Upload rejected: "File already exists"

PyPI does not allow re-uploading the same version, even if the previous upload was deleted. Bump the version number (e.g., `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1`).

### twine check fails: "warning: The description failed to render"

Your `README.md` has syntax that PyPI's renderer cannot handle. Common causes:
- Raw HTML that is not allowed
- Relative image links (use absolute URLs)
- Unsupported Markdown extensions

Test rendering locally:

```bash
pip install readme-renderer[md]
python -m readme_renderer README.md -o /tmp/readme.html
```

### TestPyPI install fails with "No matching distribution found"

- The index may not have propagated yet. Live Gate 1 polls for ~60s (10×6s); sibling publishers retry 5×10s. A remaining 404 after that ceiling is a real miss, not lag — check that the version string matches exactly (no leading `v`)
- Do not restore an unconditional `sleep 30` in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`; that sleep was neither necessary nor sufficient (juniper-ml#1310)
- Manual install from TestPyPI still needs `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` so *dependencies* resolve, but that merged-namespace form is the squatting risk the CI two-phase verify exists to avoid (see §7.2 2026-08-08 amendment)

### Trusted publishing fails: "Token request failed"

- Verify the repository, workflow filename, and environment name match exactly between GitHub and PyPI's trusted publisher settings
- Ensure the workflow has `permissions: id-token: write`
- Check that the GitHub environment name in the `environment:` field matches the one registered on PyPI (case-sensitive)

### "This package name is not available"

The name is taken on PyPI (check `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`). Choose a different `name` in `pyproject.toml`. Normalization means `my-package`, `my_package`, and `my.package` are all equivalent.

### Build produces unexpected files in the wheel

Add or update the `[tool.setuptools]` section to control what's included:

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = []    # Meta-package: no Python packages to include
```

Or use a `MANIFEST.in` to control what goes into the sdist.
