"""Idempotent ``prometheus_client`` collector helpers.

The four helpers in this module solve a recurring failure mode in the
Juniper fleet: ``prometheus_client`` collector classes (``Counter``,
``Gauge``, ``Histogram``, ``Summary``, ``Info``, ``Enum``) register
themselves with the global ``REGISTRY`` on construction and raise
``ValueError("Duplicated timeseries ...")`` if the metric name is
already present. The library does not provide a "register-if-absent"
or "get-or-create" primitive — every consumer that might re-instantiate
a collector must implement that themselves. Pre-2026-05-05 the same
try/except + REGISTRY-lookup pattern was copy-pasted in ~10 production
sites across 5 repos, with two subtly different implementations
("adopt existing" vs "drop and recreate") in the wild.

These helpers consolidate the pattern. See
``notes/observability/REGISTER_OR_REUSE_HELPER_DESIGN_2026-05-05.md``
in the juniper-ml repo for the full analysis, rationale, and
migration plan.

Public API:

- :func:`register_or_reuse` — adopt-existing on duplicate (samples
  preserved; latest call's ``args`` ignored). The default choice for
  almost every call site.
- :func:`register_fresh` — drop-and-recreate on duplicate (samples
  discarded; latest call's ``args`` take effect). Use only when a
  test fixture or migration path *intentionally* wants different
  buckets/labels.
- :func:`register_info_or_update` — sugar over :func:`register_or_reuse`
  for the ``Info`` collector, which has both a registration step and
  a separate ``.info({...})`` label-update step.
- :func:`lazy_register_or_reuse` — like :func:`register_or_reuse` but
  caches the result in a module-private dict keyed by metric name.
  For the "lazy-init with ``None`` sentinel" pattern that several
  consumers use.

All four lazy-import ``prometheus_client`` so callers without the
optional dependency only pay the import cost on the path that actually
needs the SDK. Logging is intentionally absent — consumers that want
to surface unexpected re-registrations can wrap.

    Several Juniper services keep a module-level ``_foo: Optional[T] =

    is fragile under tests that reset the module-level sentinel without
