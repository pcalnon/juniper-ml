# HANDOFF — P5 fleet rollout: four ports landed as PRs, helper folded, two sessions reconciled

**Date**: 2026-08-25
**Origin session**: `memory gov [1489a9]` — the P5 execution session started from the
memory-governance handoff
**Predecessor**: [`HANDOFF_2026-08-25_memory-governance-and-p5-fleet-rollout.md`](HANDOFF_2026-08-25_memory-governance-and-p5-fleet-rollout.md)
**Sibling** (same handoff, concurrent session `memory governance [cdf594]`):
`HANDOFF_2026-08-25_p5-ports-and-session-split.md` (archive PR ml#1380) — owns cascor-client#139
and recurrence#131.

**Validation status: SELF-REVIEWED ONLY.** Four independent refuting agents (grounding /
completeness-executability / adversarial-consequence / procedure-conformance) were launched and
all four terminated on the API session limit before reporting a single finding. The author
re-probed the concrete claims alone (see *Validation* at the end). **The next session should run
the four-lens refutation pass on this document before acting on its tables** — the arc's record
is that first drafts carry ~14 CRITICAL findings and that the *correction* pass introduces new
ones (ml#1373).

*[Four-lens pass run 2026-08-26 by the continuation session `p5 ports, session split`: a second
attempt with eight refuting agents (four per sibling handoff) died on the same API session limit, so
the four lenses were run in sequence by one session against primary sources. Corrections are
annotated in place as *[…]* and summarised under "Validation — four-lens pass (2026-08-26)".]*

## Handoff prompt (copy this into the new thread)

Continue the **shared-session-memory** arc in `juniper-ml`, P5 fleet-rollout phase. State at
handoff: **8 of 9 governable repos have a memory-budget port merged or open, all ADVISORY, none
promoted.** juniper-slacker has no `AGENTS.md` and nothing to govern.

Authorities, in order:
- Plan §P5: [`notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-18_JUNIPER-ML_SHARED-SESSION-MEMORY-PLAN.md`](../../notes/JUNIPER_2026-08-18_JUNIPER-ML_SHARED-SESSION-MEMORY-PLAN.md)
  — its status banner, rate table, promotion procedure and porting hazards are rewritten in
  **ml#1376 (open)**. Until that merges, `main`'s copy still says *NOT STARTED*; read the PR.
- Tracking issue **ml#1326** — title fixed; the comment thread is the live tracker (the peer's
  23:41Z table, then this session's four-PR table).
- Soak ledger §7/§14 and the memory-mechanism facts: unchanged from the predecessor.

### Completed this session

| PR | Repo | What | Head | State at handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ml#1376** | juniper-ml | plan §P5 IN PROGRESS + measured rate table + safe promotion procedure (four preconditions); REFERENCE.md ADVISORY→BLOCKING + `--base-ref`/`--trailers-file`; archived-handoff corrections (22/22→24/24, `--require-observed` does not exist) | `6b8c704a` | 20/20 green, BEHIND |
| **ml#1379** | juniper-ml | helper: `render-job`/`render-workflow`/`render-config` (figures MEASURED in the target), nearest-rank p90, `adapt-test --sub-project/--header-version/--pytest-marker` + reasoned `# nosec B404`, insert-job dup guard, repo name from origin URL, `2026-08-25_p5_port_verify.bash`; 23 hermetic tests wired into ci.yml; AGENTS.md date bumped | `72aa582c` | CI running, BEHIND |
| **data-client#173** | juniper-data-client | P5 port, ceiling 28,369 | `410b8770` | open |
| **data#291** | juniper-data | P5 port, ceiling 43,493 (depth-3 test, `pytestmark = unit`) | `c940ba07` | open |
| **cascor-worker#162** | juniper-cascor-worker | P5 port, ceiling 35,126 | `77be6907` | open |
| **deploy#195** | juniper-deploy | P5 port, ceiling 34,569 (`conf/` created, `PYTHON_VERSION`) | `a732d2c6` | CLEAN |

Peer session (do not redo): **cascor-client#139** (ceiling 34,695) and **recurrence#131**
(standalone `memory-budget.yml`, sequence-safety shape) — **both MERGED 2026-08-26 06:02Z**. The
peer's ml#1375 and ml#1378 were **closed as superseded** by #1376/#1379; their branches are kept
and #1378's four deltas are already folded into #1379 *[2026-08-26: partly — `measure-growth
--ref` never reached `main`; see Validation]*. Also done: ml#1239 adjudication comment
posted (owner closes — main-verify has been green for its last five runs); ml#1326 retitled.

**A merge run was in progress when this was written.** The peer reported that the owner granted
merge authorization for the whole P5 PR set *in the peer's session* and began merging
sequentially with `util/safe_merge.py --execute` (#139 → #131 → ml#1376 → ml#1379 → ml#1380 →
data-client#173 → data#291 → cascor-worker#162 → deploy#195), reporting each `mergedAt` on
ml#1326. This session merged nothing and did not treat that report as its own authorization.
**Every "open"/"BEHIND"/"CLEAN" in the table above is a snapshot — re-verify with the commands
below before doing anything that depends on a PR's state.**

Every commit above is a local YubiKey signature, checked after push with the attribution
diagnostic: `verified=true reason=valid login=pcalnon` on all six of this session's heads.

### Remaining work

**1. Confirm what the merge run actually landed — do not merge on this document's authority.**
Merges happen only on Paul's explicit approval; the peer says it holds that for this set, so the
next session's job is verification, not merging: `gh pr view <N> --json state,mergedAt` for all
eight, then a marker grep on each repo's `origin/main` (`grep -c "memory-budget:"
.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `conf/memory_budget.json` present) *[for juniper-recurrence grep
`.github/workflows/memory-budget.yml` — it has no `ci.yml`]*. Anything still OPEN stays open
until Paul says otherwise. #1376 and #1379 both touch `docs/REFERENCE.md` in different regions
(budget usage block + utility line vs. the test-suite reference), so whichever merges second goes
BEHIND and needs `update-branch`, not a hand rebase. Each port PR is a single signed commit; keep
it so (the squash trap in memory). `safe_merge`'s `MERGED #N` line only exists if `safe_merge` did
the merge; a native merge prints nothing.

**2. Worktree cleanup only after MERGED *and* Paul's own signal to this lineage.** The peer's
relayed merge authorization is not a cleanup signal. Six port worktrees carry the PRs (paths under
*Git status*); two older ones hold the merged canopy/cascor ports. Run
`util/ad-hoc/2026-08-20_worktree_liveness_probe.py` before removing any — merged-and-clean does
not mean idle, and this session found a peer's agents writing into its worktrees. `worktree
remove` also deletes ignored files. The four `feat/memory-budget-gate` local branches in the
sibling primaries go with them (`git branch -d` after MERGED; `git worktree prune`).

**3. Promotion: still NOT yet, for every repo.** The four preconditions (ml#1376 plan §P5 step
d): merged to that repo's `main`; `--advisory` removed; the three controls re-run against the
non-advisory job; real slack declared with `Allow-Ceiling-Raise: AGENTS.md`. Then
`util/ad-hoc/2026-08-20_require_context_safely.py --repo juniper-<x> --context 'Memory Budget'
--apply` — observed-only is the default, `--allow-unobserved` is the opt-out, and its default
roster omits recurrence so always pass `--repo`.

**4. Slack, when promotion is near.** Every ceiling is zero-slack by design. The same **+1,982**
growth appears in six of eight repos — the 2026-08-21 base-branch-guard docs sweep (ml#434) —
so the class to absorb is one PR that grows every `AGENTS.md` at once; size each raise from that
repo's re-measured `max` (canopy 1,982; cascor 9,609).

**5. `docs/REFERENCE.md` must exist in cascor and recurrence before any cut** (step e). Unchanged.

**6. Owner decisions carried forward unchanged**: the soak's next step (policy stratum 24/24 =
100% — rung 1 as stated is a null experiment); parent `Juniper/AGENTS.md` and the worktree
settings asymmetry (LEAVE IT); MEMORY.md 120-byte cap on new entries only.

### Key context

- **Two sessions started from the same handoff and collided within the hour.** `gh pr list`
  as the only dup-guard was blind for ~30 minutes because the peer had not pushed. Before
  starting a port, also check the target's `git worktree list` and local branches — the
  collision surfaced only as `fatal: a branch named 'feat/memory-budget-gate' already exists`.
  Cross-session `SendMessage` to a `ListAgents` peer worked both ways here.
- **A peer's agents wrote into this session's worktrees** (deploy and data-client test files,
  differing from the rendered artifact by one line each). Before committing any port, regenerate
  the file from the renderer and `diff` — that check is now what `verify.bash` + the helper make
  cheap. Never trust a worktree you did not just write to.
- **The harness refuses "complex" shell from a worktree-isolated session**: `for` loops,
  `$(…)`, `${PIPESTATUS}`, and long heredocs containing git-shaped text. Plain commands, `&&`
  chains and `git -C <sibling>` work. That is why `2026-08-25_p5_port_verify.bash` exists — one
  plain command per repo. When Bash refuses a file write, the Write/Edit tools are the fallback.
  *[2026-08-26: `$(…)` and plain `git -C <sibling>` both executed in a bypass-permissions session;
  the refusal class was not reproduced there and likely depends on the permission mode.]*
- **API `byteSize` is not the ceiling's unit.** The census read canopy at 96,355 *bytes* against
  a 95,133-*char* ceiling and this session briefly concluded both repos were already over. In
  chars both were exactly at ceiling. Measure with the helper, never with the contents API.
- **Per-repo traps, all invisible to pre-commit and to the ported file's own tests**: client and
  worker repos' tests-scope bandit does not skip **B404** (ml's does) — annotate the import;
  cascor forbids `Version:` lines, data-client requires them to equal `__version__`; juniper-data
  selects `-m "unit and not slow"` over `juniper_data/tests/unit` — depth 3 + marker or the port
  is vacuous; cascor-worker's `conf/` existed only untracked in the primary (absent in a fresh
  worktree); deploy has no `conf/`, no bandit, and `PYTHON_VERSION` not `PYTHON_TEST_VERSION`.
- **`gh pr edit --body-file` fails on juniper-ml** with a GraphQL `projectCards` deprecation;
  `gh api -X PATCH repos/pcalnon/juniper-ml/pulls/<N> -F body=@file` works.
- **The measure tool's p90 was wrong below n≈10** (floor index; printed p90 < median for four
  repos). Fixed in #1379; slack recommendations always used `max`, so no ceiling was mis-sized.
- **`render-workflow` is unused**: recurrence#131 hand-built the standalone workflow first. It
  stays in the helper for any future repo without a `ci.yml`.
- Local signing works non-interactively here (`gpg --card-status`: `UIF Sign=off`); the
  YubiKey must be present. Always run the attribution diagnostic right after pushing.

```

Full local pre-flight before any push is unchanged from the predecessor (pre-commit on changed
paths, both ref-diff screens with ml's exact three `--scope`s, doc-links, budget check with
`--base-ref origin/main --trailers-file` when the branch carries a trailer). Extracting a function
body trips the symbol screen as WEAKENED; the waiver goes in the one commit.

## Git status at handoff

- Session worktree `.claude/worktrees/dreamy-crunching-kettle` (harness-created). Branches
  pushed: `docs/p5-status-and-stale-figures` (#1376), `chore/p5-helper-render-job` (#1379); the
  handoff branch carrying this file. Tree clean apart from this file at the time of writing.
- Port worktrees under `/home/pcalnon/Development/python/Juniper/worktrees/`, branch
  `feat/memory-budget-gate` in each, all pushed, **PRs open — do not remove**:
  `juniper-data-client--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-1852--4a32a343`,
  `juniper-data--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-1852--b4db8f61`,
  `juniper-cascor-worker--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-1852--ee3cd44c`,
  `juniper-deploy--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-1852--1bb421a8`. The peer's:
  `…juniper-cascor-client--…--20260825-1826--f5a90304`, `…juniper-recurrence--…--20260825-1848--d9688520`.
- Older, merged: `juniper-canopy--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-0507--04f06ffe`,
  `juniper-cascor--feat--memory-budget-gate--20260825-0515--c4bbe815` — owner signal + liveness
  probe before removal.
- A throwaway venv for data-client's `[test]` extra lives in the session scratchpad; disposable.
- The juniper-ml primary checkout was at `45c2f4fc` = `origin/main` when this session started
  (the predecessor's "13 behind" had already been resolved); `origin/main` has since advanced.
  Phase 7 (sync the primary) applies only after a merged-PR cleanup — none was performed here.

## Corrections to the predecessor

- Its *FIRST ACTION* (commit the handoff, open the archive PR) had already happened: ml#1363
  merged 22:59Z, before this session began. Its six "OPEN" PRs were all MERGED by 21:32Z, and
  cascor#585 was green and merged at 10:54Z. Verify state before acting on a handoff's tables.
- The primary checkout was not behind at session start.
- The `--require-observed` flag it recommends does not exist (corrected in place, and in plan
  §P5 via #1376). The `22/22` policy-stratum figure is corrected in the 08-23 handoff.
- The `2026-08-25_p5_port_memory_budget.py` path it cites now lives on `main` (ml#1359 merged);
  the render/verify additions are on #1379.

## Validation

Four refuting agents were launched against the draft and **all four died on the API session
limit before reporting** ("resets 10:40pm America/Chicago"). What the author re-probed alone
before archiving, each against a primary source: every PR number, head SHA and state
(`gh pr view` / the commits API — all six heads `verified=true login=pcalnon`); the ceilings and
rates (re-run of `measure-growth`, four repos byte-identical to the rendered artifact); the
helper's flags (`--help`) and its 23 tests (run); `require_context_safely.py`'s roster (the file
never mentions `juniper-recurrence`); the +1,982 fan-out commit (`docs(agents): document the PR
base-branch guard (ml#434)`, 2026-08-21, in deploy's log); the archive filename test; the
verification block's `gh pr view` lines (run; they exposed the merge run above). **Not covered:**
an independent reader's executability pass over "Remaining work", the adversarial-consequence
lens, and a conformance read against the handoff procedure. Run those first.

## Note on length

~2,000 words against the procedure's ~500; the predecessor measured the corpus median at 1,093
with 12% of archived handoffs meeting the rule. Same proportionate remedy applies: amend the
procedure to the observed working figure or add a gate — not compress this one.

## Validation — four-lens pass (2026-08-26)

Run by the continuation session (`p5 ports, session split`) against primary sources, one session
running the four lenses in sequence: eight refuting agents (four per sibling handoff) were launched
first and all died on the API session limit before reporting — the same failure recorded at the top.
Corrections are annotated in place as *[…]* and summarised here.

**Findings**

- **MAJOR (grounding)** — "#1378's four deltas are already folded into #1379": partly. On `main`
  the helper has `adapt-test --sub-project` / `--header-version` / `--pytest-marker`, the reasoned
  `# nosec B404`, the `insert-job` duplicate guard and `repo_name()` from the origin URL (marker
  grep 9; 23 hermetic tests pass) — but NOT `measure-growth --ref`: `--help` lists only `--days` and
  `--ref origin/main` is `unrecognized arguments`. It lived only on `chore/p5-toolkit-seed-and-render`
  @ `cb8a4b73`. On `main` the helper reads the checkout's HEAD; fast-forward the primary before
  measuring. Both primaries re-measured 2026-08-26 were at `origin/main` and the figures were unchanged.
- **MAJOR (missing hazard)** — the `Memory Budget` job is `if: pull_request || merge_group` in every
  port, so its check-run on every `main` commit reads **`skipped`** (recurrence's standalone
  workflow is `pull_request`-only and publishes nothing on `main`). Neither sibling handoff says so;
  a reader running the promotion pre-flight could read that as "not observed". The pre-flight's
  `observed_contexts()` reads check-run names on the eight most recently updated PR heads,
  conclusion-agnostic — `--status --context 'Memory Budget'` reports observed **YES** on all eight
  repos (2026-08-26). Recorded in plan §P5 step d the same day.
- **MINOR (executability)** — item 1's marker grep `grep -c "memory-budget:" .github/workflows/ci.yml`
  has no target in juniper-recurrence (no `ci.yml`); grep `.github/workflows/memory-budget.yml`.
- **MINOR (executability)** — the verification block's `git show origin/chore/p5-helper-render-job:…`
  fails: the branch was deleted when #1379 merged (06:21Z). The helper and its 23 tests are on `main`.
- **MINOR (conformance)** — 2,060 words against the procedure's "~500"; acknowledged in *Note on
  length*. The archive-name gate (`tests/test_thread_handoff_archive.py`) passes.

**Confirmed against primary sources**: every head SHA in *Completed this session* is the first
commit of its PR (`pulls/N/commits`); the four target ports are single commits, `verified=true
reason=valid login=pcalnon` (data#291 probed); `conf/memory_budget.json` present on data,
recurrence and worker `main`; #1376 and #1379 both touch `docs/REFERENCE.md`; ml#1239 open with
the 23:35Z adjudication comment; ml#1363 merged 22:59:31Z; canopy `AGENTS.md` = 96,355 bytes /
95,133 chars; `UIF … Sign=off`; nearest-rank p90 and all six subcommands (incl. `render-workflow`)
on `main`; the `projectCards` failure is recorded in four other archived handoffs; `--allow-unobserved`
exists, `--require-observed` does not, and the default roster omits juniper-recurrence; plain
`git -C <sibling>` and `$(…)` both executed here; `soak_ledger.py status` exits 1; AGENTS.md at the
archive commit is 37,019 chars; the actual merge order differed from the planned sequence quoted
above (the four target ports landed 06:09–06:10Z, before #1379 at 06:21Z) — a snapshot, not a defect.
