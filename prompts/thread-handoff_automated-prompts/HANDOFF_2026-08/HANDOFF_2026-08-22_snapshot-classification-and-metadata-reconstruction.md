# HANDOFF 2026-08-22 — snapshot classification and metadata reconstruction

Successor to
[`HANDOFF_2026-08-19_snapshot-arc-closeout-and-r3-resume.md`](HANDOFF_2026-08-19_snapshot-arc-closeout-and-r3-resume.md).

**Nothing from this arc is in flight.** Eleven PRs merged (6 juniper-ml, 5 juniper-cascor); every
one is on `main` and green. The snapshot lifecycle design's §6.1–§6.3 are closed and §6.4 is
unblocked. What remains is the **owner's classification scheme** (§2), which is new design work,
not cleanup.

Citations are `file:NNN`. Line numbers drift constantly in `manager.py` / `snapshot_serializer.py`
— **re-derive before editing**; two merges this arc shifted `manager.py` by ~66 lines each.

> ⚠ **Three findings in this document contradict a plausible first reading of the same data.**
> Each is marked. They were all caught by checking a case whose answer was known in advance; none
> was caught by review. Do not re-derive them from intuition.

## 2. The owner's classification scheme — THE remaining design work

Recorded 2026-08-22, and it supersedes the framing in ml#1247 §3. Reproduce faithfully; the
reasoning matters as much as the categories.

### 2.1 Iterations, not epochs

> *"Number of iterations is the important measure of training duration. Number of epochs — both
> for output training and for candidate pool training — is essentially meaningless."*

- Output training's **principal metric is accuracy**, not epoch count: whether a round ran its
  full budget or stopped early is not significant.
- Candidate-pool training's **product is the best candidate meeting the correlation threshold**.
  Epochs spent are effectively irrelevant.

**Therefore: hidden-node count is a LOWER BOUND on completed cascor iterations.** Each installed
hidden node required one successfully completed iteration. Some unknown number of iterations may
have run without finding a candidate that cleared the threshold, so the true count is ≥ the node
count.

This is why ml#1247 is framed on `arch.num_hidden_units` — and it is now the *right* framing for
a second reason, not just because the epoch counters are broken (§4.1).

### 2.2 Inference is sufficient for accuracy

A snapshot that loads can, by definition, perform inference. So **every loadable snapshot yields
two recoverable attributes**: a lower bound on iterations, and a network accuracy value.

### 2.3 Zero hidden nodes as a prima facie signal

Zero hidden nodes is a *prima facie* indication the network could not perform normal cascor
operations. **The owner flags this as a deliberate overgeneralisation** — useful if we accept that
the interesting networks are those that operated well enough to grow.

To go deeper: **load the no-hidden-node snapshots and initiate standard training.** At that point
current training performance becomes the only truly interesting attribute, and its behaviour fills
in the missing metadata. A snapshot that then fails to train belongs to a different subset —
dysfunctional networks.

### 2.4 Draft categories

1. **fails to load**
2. **fails to train**
3. **formerly broken** — reloads without hidden nodes, but *is* able to train
4. **loads hidden nodes**
5. **fully attributed** — snapshots generated going forward with full metadata

### 2.5 The intended sequence

> initial classification → network inference → training operations → use the resulting data to
> fill out missing snapshot metadata.

---

## 3. Remaining work, in dependency order

1. **Classifier (read-only) over the §6.2 index** — categories 1, 4, 5 are already derivable
   without opening a file: `readable`, `arch.num_hidden_units > 0`, `provenance != null`.
2. **Inference pass** — load each loadable snapshot, run inference, record accuracy. Needs a
   dataset; the cohort is uniformly 2-in/2-out synthetic (§4.3), so a generated spiral/moons set
   is the plausible stand-in. **Whether accuracy against a *substitute* dataset is meaningful is
   an open question for the owner** — the original dataset identity is unrecoverable (§4.2).

**Inference pass to infer dataset:** for any snapshot with hidden nodes, it's a reasonable, initial assumption that some amount of training has taken place on an existing dataset.
since inference is computationally cheap, network accuracy per dataset can be calculated for all cascor, 2-in -> 2-out datasets.
getting a better than random accuracy for a dataset, is a strong--but not definitive--indicator that the network trained on that dataset.
in the--perhaps unlikely?--scenario of a network scoring better than chance on multiple, 2-in -> 2-out datasets, the stronger--but still not definitive--conclusion would be to select the dataset associated with the largest increase in accuracy over chance.

3. **Training probe for the zero-node subset** — separates *formerly broken* (trains) from *fails
   to train* (dysfunctional). This is the expensive step: ~11,751 networks.
4. **Backfill** — write the recovered attributes somewhere. **Do not write into the snapshots**
   without an explicit decision: they are read-only project assets and the index is the natural
   home.

**Metadata backfill for research value:** my instinct here is that backfilling metadata would tend to increase the research value of snapshots.
caveating backfilled snapshots with a clear and visible label capturing the approximate, inferred, or recreated nature of their metadata would be a potentially important caution against naive reasoning.
for the broken datasets, root causing their issues seems likely to be the greatest value contributor.
in particular, root cause determination of the formatting or data issues affecting the "fails to load" snapshots would be helpful.
research value of "fails to train" snapshots would likely benefit from determining root causes of the network topology issues preventing training.
once root-causing has been carried out on the broken snapshot categories, any further value seems unlikely.
saving a compressed, encrypted archive of the entire project tree--including snapshots--using the new juniper_backup.bash script seems likely to be a sufficient safeguard against future need for potentially removed snapshots.
alertnately, using the index rather than write into the snapshots also seems like an option worth investigating.

5. **§6.4 retention** — the owner's call, now informed.

**Retention Criterion:** future research value seems like an obvious first approximation of a criterion for evaluating snapshot retention.
**Supporting Infrastructure:** what this section seems to argue for is the addition of tooling, infrastructure, and automation supporting the snapshot classification process.
ideally, this tooling would include implementation of scripting to root cause the formatting or data issues affecting the "fails to load" snapshots.
for "fails to train" snapshots, scripting to determine the network topology issues preventing training would be significant.
this tooling and infrastructure seems likely to be invaluable going forward to investigate future instances of failing networks.

6. **Inert-metadata defect (§4.1)** → defect-register entry + a cascor writer fix. Not started.

## 4. Findings that constrain the work

### 4.1 ⚠ `meta.current_epoch` / `snapshot_counter` / `best_value_loss` are INERT

`current_epoch` is `0` across **all 27,908** snapshots — including all 174 snapshots of a network
that grew **0 → 260 hidden units**. `snapshot_counter` is `0`; `best_value_loss` is `inf`.

**The false reading this produced:** *"every snapshot is at epoch 0, so nothing was trained here"*
— which would have justified deleting 27,005 real models. It only came apart on checking a network
known to have grown. Three fields that look like training-progress metadata are dead.

Independently confirmed by the owner's §2.1 reasoning: even if they worked, epochs would be the
wrong measure. **Use `arch.num_hidden_units`.**

### 4.2 ⚠ Identity is UNRECOVERABLE for the Mar–Apr cohort

**Zero surviving experiment run dirs before 2026-07-30** (267 exist; earliest `20260730T…`; the
cohort is March–April). ml#1244's `run_id → manifest → dataset_id` join needs both halves and the
cohort has neither. Do not propose retroactive attribution — it was checked and it is gone.

### 4.3 The cohort, measured (ml#1247)

27,005 snapshots (96.8% of archive), 1.7 GiB, 16,462 networks, all readable, cascor 0.3.2/0.4.0.

|                     | networks | snapshots | bytes    |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| grew ≥1 hidden unit | 4,711    | 15,057    | 1.17 GiB |
| never grew          | 11,751   | 11,948    | 499 MiB  |

Never-grew are **not untrained** — 200/200 sampled had non-zero `output_weights`. Architecture is uniformly (2 in, 2 out) with 0–3 hidden: the synthetic-generator family, not equities.

### 4.4 ⚠ The four-day cluster is a VOLUME event, not a failure event

Per the owner's instruction, cascor PRs merged in the 3–5 days before 2026-03-31 were reviewed.  The window is dense with directly relevant work:

| PR       | date     | title                                                                       |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #43–#57  | 03-29/30 | metrics emission, candidate-progress streaming, TrainingMonitor refactors   |
| #58      | 04-02    | resolve resource tracker KeyErrors                                          |
| #60, #61 | 04-03    | **critical training failure** / resource leak from OPT-5 SharedMemory       |
| #64      | 04-04    | **rename epoch → iteration in `grow_network` for correct CasCor semantics** |
| #66      | 04-04    | resolve training stalling, add growth iteration semantics                   |

**The tempting conclusion — "the OPT-5 training failure caused the never-grow cluster" — is not supported.** Both categories spike together and collapse together:

| day       | never-grew | grew   |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 03-31     | 1,263      | 1,548  |
| 04-01     | 2,059      | 3,738  |
| 04-02     | 751        | 1,103  |
| 04-03     | 1,962      | 1,417  |
| **04-04** | **71**     | **87** |

The never-grew *fraction* during the cluster (~44%) matches the cohort-wide rate. So it is the heaviest experimentation period in the archive — a debugging campaign against exactly those training failures — that ended abruptly on 04-04 when #64/#66 landed. Note #64 renamed epoch → iteration for correct CasCor semantics, which is the same distinction §2.1 draws.

## 5. Traps this arc paid for — read before starting

1. **`util/open_signed_pr.py` sends WHOLE FILES.** It silently reverts any concurrent change to
   those paths. Re-check **immediately before pushing**, not at sync time:
   `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main -- <paths you will --add>` (want empty). Cost this arc one
   clobber of `docs/REFERENCE.md`.
2. **A docs-screen deletion count larger than your edit means CLOBBER, not "add a waiver".** The
   screen suggests `Allow-Docs-Rewrite:`; adding it cements someone else's deleted work. Rebase.
3. **Run the sequence-safety screens locally before pushing**, every time
   (`juniper-symbol-loss-check`, `juniper-docs-additions-check` vs `origin/main`). Skipping one
   PR in a turn is how the clobber reached CI. **Extract-method refactors trip the symbol screen
   as `WEAKENED`** and need `Allow-Symbol-Loss: method:<Class>.<name>` **in the first commit**.
4. **`safe_merge.py` false negatives.** Exit 3 twice on PRs that HAD merged (deleted head ref;
   base-branch race). Always check `gh pr view <n> --json state` before retrying. ml#1242 has
   since fixed the net-won case.
5. **`tests/` has weaker lint than `util/`** in juniper-ml — flake8 is relaxed there, so an unused
   import passes locally and **CodeQL blocks the merge via an unresolved review thread while every
   required check is green**.
6. **`ls dir/*.h5 | wc -l` returns 0 at ~28k files** (ARG_MAX; `ls` fails silently). Use `find`.
7. **`train_output_layer` calls `create_snapshot()` unconditionally.** cascor#558 stopped the test
   suite leaking into the shared archive, but any ad-hoc script with the provenance env set still
   writes there. Set `JUNIPER_CASCOR_SNAPSHOTS_DIR` for probes.
8. **`util/snapshot_index.py` is READ-ONLY by construction**, enforced by an AST test. Retention
   is §6.4; do not add a `--prune` while implementing the classifier.

no longer exists.

## 7. Git state and procedure

- **juniper-ml** — this arc's last merge was **`be644c3`** (ml#1247), but main had already advanced
  to `c88a23d` before this handoff was written. **Re-probe; do not trust this SHA.** Parallel
  sessions merge to juniper-ml continuously — main moved roughly a dozen times during this arc,
  which is also what makes trap §5.1 live rather than theoretical.
- **juniper-cascor** `origin/main` **`7e06dc6`** (cascor#558) at handoff — quieter, but re-probe.
- Zero open PRs in either repo at handoff (verified, and stale within minutes).
- No worktrees from this arc remain; all were removed, branches deleted, `git worktree prune` run.
- **Worktrees are the standing default** for task work, centralized in `Juniper/worktrees/`.
- **`required_signatures` is live fleet-wide** — a headless local commit cannot land. Use
  `juniper-ml/util/open_signed_pr.py`; to amend a PR already in flight it refuses (by design), so
  use `createCommitOnBranch` with `expectedHeadOid` pinned, and only re-cut the PR when a waiver
  trailer must ride the first commit.
- **Merge queues are unavailable to Juniper** (user-owned repos) — settled policy, do not
  re-raise. Use `util/safe_merge.py`.
