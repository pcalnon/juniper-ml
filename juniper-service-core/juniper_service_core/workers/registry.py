"""Thread-safe registry for connected workers (WS-2 / OUT-11 T2 step 3a).

The de-cascored core of cascor's ``api/workers/registry.py`` (CLEAN per design §5.6: the
pool-infra layer is model-agnostic). Tracks worker connections, capabilities, heartbeats, and
health scores, and enforces one active connection per ``worker_id`` (a new connection replaces
the old). The cascade-specific task payload never reaches here -- ``active_task_id`` is an opaque
string assigned by the coordinator (step 3b), so this registry is fully generic.

Pure stdlib -- no third-party import, safe on the dependency-free import path.
