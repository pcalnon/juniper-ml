"""Boot-time auth-posture self-check (SEC-F01) — fail closed before a service binds open.

The security companion to the E-8 dependency-floor self-check (:mod:`dependency_floors`):
that stops a service serving on top of a below-floor wheel; this stops a service that is
*meant* to require API-key auth from silently serving **wide open** because no keys were
configured. A service calls :func:`enforce_auth_posture` at startup — before it binds —
passing its resolved API keys and whether auth is required in this deployment. If auth is
required but no real key is configured, the call raises :class:`AuthPostureError` and the
server fails loudly instead of coming up with authentication silently disabled.

This is the failure mode confirmed in the containerized-stack security audit (SEC-F01 /
HO-2): every juniper HTTP service computes ``enabled = len(api_keys) > 0`` and, with an
empty/placeholder secret, disables ``APIKeyAuth`` and serves protected routes
unauthenticated — with no startup error and a ``healthy`` health check. ``prepare_secrets``
maps the ``CHANGE_BEFORE_PRODUCTION_USE`` placeholder to an *empty* file, so a missing or
undecryptable secret bundle silently drops the whole stack into an open posture.

**Posture, not authentication.** This helper does not authenticate anyone; it asserts that
the *intended* posture matches the *configured* one. Three outcomes:

* auth configured (>=1 real key)     -> ``INFO`` (secured), returns;
* no keys + ``require_auth`` False    -> loud ``WARNING`` (running OPEN), returns;
* no keys + ``require_auth`` True     -> ``CRITICAL`` + raise :class:`AuthPostureError`.

Keep ``require_auth`` False for an intentional open dev/demo profile; set it True (and
populate the key secret) for any secured deployment, so an empty secret is a boot failure
rather than open access.

**Dependency-light.** Stdlib only, preserving the dependency-free ``import
juniper_service_core`` guarantee.

**Escape hatch.** ``JUNIPER_SKIP_AUTH_POSTURE_CHECK`` (by default), when truthy, bypasses
the check — logged loudly — so a false positive can never permanently block a legitimate
start.
