    authentication -- and :class:`~juniper_service_core.middleware.SecurityMiddleware` therefore
    never reaches it when auth raises. The result is that the entire 401 path consumes no budget

    Reordering is the wrong fix. Running the identity-keyed limiter first would mean ``api_key``
    is always ``None`` at that point, so every caller shares one ``ip:`` bucket -- collapsing all

    This throttle only ever consumes budget on a **failed** attempt, which is what makes it safe
    to enable by default: a caller presenting a valid key is never counted, so well-behaved
    traffic sees no behaviour change whatsoever. It is a security control, not a fairness quota,
