# Changelog

All notable changes to `juniper-service-core` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`APIKeyAuth.validate` no longer short-circuits its walk over the configured keys**
  (`APD-CASCOR-005`). It accumulated into `any(hmac.compare_digest(api_key, k) for k in
  self._api_keys)`, which stops at the first match, so the NUMBER of comparisons performed
  depended on where the matching key fell in the iteration. `compare_digest` already makes each
  individual comparison constant-time in the key's *content*; the iteration is the part that was
  not. Now mirrors juniper-data's reference implementation
  (`juniper_data/api/security.py`), which has never short-circuited.

  **Scope, stated honestly:** this is defence-in-depth and a convergence of four near-identical
  copies, not the repair of a live vulnerability. What `any()` leaked is the *position* of the
  matching key within the iteration, not the key; and `self._api_keys` is a `set` here, whose
  iteration order is hash-derived rather than configuration order. The reason to do it is that
  divergence between forked copies of security code is the shape that has produced five separate
  register findings (register §2.3, "Copy drift").

  **No behavioural test pins this, and none can:** the two forms return the same value for every
  input. The guard is therefore a source marker in juniper-ml's
  `tests/test_service_fork_drift.py` (`nonshortcircuit-key-compare`), which was verified to FAIL
  against the unported forks before being committed.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **`WorkerCoordinator.release_worker_tasks` — new public method on an exported class.** The shared
  helper that returns a worker's in-flight tasks to the unassigned queue. Idempotent, and takes
  `free_worker` so an abort on a still-connected worker also marks it idle. `WorkerCoordinator` is
  exported from `juniper_service_core` (`__init__.py:193`, lazy map `:276`), so this is **new public
  API surface**, which is what makes the release carrying it a minor rather than a patch under
  SemVer §7. Filed here rather than under `Fixed` deliberately: the behaviour change below is what
  the work was *for*, but the new method is what consumers can now call, and the release-train
  detector derives its bump proposal from these headings.

### Fixed

- **Worker-stream disconnect and mid-result abort now reclaim in-flight tasks.** A clean
  `/ws/workers` disconnect used to `deregister` without returning the assigned task to the
  unassigned queue, so a round with that worker as the sole assignee waited the full
  `task_reassignment_timeout` (default 120s) even though the worker was already gone. The
  stale-heartbeat sweep already requeued; disconnect did not. The same hole existed on
  expected-binary-got-text and oversize attachment aborts: the handler sent an error and
  returned while leaving the worker busy, so `_try_dispatch_task` could not redispatch.
  Both paths now go through `release_worker_tasks` (above).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **A guard on the three parallel declarations of the public surface** (`APD-SVCCORE-009`).
  `__all__`, the `_LAZY_EXPORTS` name→module map, and the `TYPE_CHECKING` import block are
  maintained by hand and nothing checked that they agree. They did agree, which is exactly when
  the guard is worth adding: the failure mode is a name exported but unresolvable
  (`AttributeError` for a consumer) or resolvable but invisible to type checkers, and neither
  surfaces until someone hits it. The lists are read from source with `ast`, because
  `TYPE_CHECKING` is `False` at run time and its block is one of the three things under test.
  A behavioural arm additionally resolves every exported name, which is what catches a typo'd
  module path in the lazy map — that passes every list comparison.

- **`JuniperServiceCoreError`** — a package base exception, exported eagerly from the package
  root (defect register `APD-SVCCORE-006`). Before it, the exceptions this package raises had
  nothing in common: three subclassed `RuntimeError` and two `KeyError`, so catching "anything
  juniper-service-core raises" meant naming them all, and the nearest category — `except
  RuntimeError` — also swallowed unrelated runtime failures that should propagate.
  **Additive**: each exception now derives from the base *in addition to* its original base, never
  instead of it, so an existing `except RuntimeError` / `except KeyError` handler is unaffected.
  `SnapshotNotFoundError` in particular is raised where a mapping lookup would be, and callers
  legitimately treat it as a `KeyError`.
  Exported eagerly alongside `__version__` because a consumer must be able to write `except
  JuniperServiceCoreError` without the lazy PEP 562 machinery importing fastapi /
  pydantic-settings to resolve the name; `exceptions.py` is dependency-free, and the blocked-import
  smoke test now covers that.
  **One deliberate exclusion**: `UnknownTunableError` keeps `KeyError` alone. `websocket/tunables.py`
  is pinned stdlib-only and standalone by two tests, one of which loads it *by file path bypassing
  the package `__init__`* — importing the package base there would erase that property, to add a
  base to the one exception in the package with no production consumer. The exclusion is asserted,
  so it stays a decision rather than an oversight.

- **`DependencyFloorError.violations`** — the structured `tuple[FloorViolation, ...]` behind the
  message (`APD-SVCCORE-014`). `check_dependency_floors` computes distribution / floor / installed
  per row and `enforce_dependency_floors` used to render that into prose and discard it, leaving a
  caller to parse the text back apart to learn which distribution to upgrade. The message is
  byte-identical; the structure is simply also available, and single-argument construction still
  works.

- **`FailedAuthThrottle` + `build_failed_auth_throttle(...)`** — an IP-keyed, fixed-window throttle
  for *failed* authentication attempts, checked before authentication and consuming budget only on
  a 401. `SecurityMiddleware` gains an optional `failed_auth_throttle=` argument and **enables one
  by default** (10 failures per 60 s per source IP), returning 429 with `Retry-After` past the
  budget.
  Defaulting to enabled is safe because budget is spent only on failure: a caller presenting a
  valid key is never counted, so well-behaved traffic sees no behaviour change whatsoever. A 429
  from the quota limiter is deliberately *not* counted either — it is a quota outcome, not a
  credential guess, and counting it would let an authenticated caller throttle itself out of the
  auth path by exceeding its own quota. Opt out with
  `build_failed_auth_throttle(enabled=False)`.
  Both names are exported through the lazy PEP 562 surface, so the dependency-free top-level
  import is unchanged.
  Note the throttle is in-memory and per-process: behind multiple replicas the effective budget
  multiplies by the replica count, and exact fleet-wide enforcement needs a shared store.

- **`JsonTaskProtocol`** — the package default `WorkerTaskProtocol`, a JSON-only worker with no
  binary frames (`APD-SVCCORE-015`). The `LifecycleCommandExecutor` analogue for the worker seam:
  publishing the Protocol *and* a working default means a consumer implements the three methods
  only when it actually carries a model-specific wire schema. Structural, not inherited — a
  consumer may use it, wrap it, or ignore it.
  **Derived, not invented**: the envelope is the one this package's own tests already wrote from
  scratch three times, and `PendingTask`'s docstring already named the shape ("a JSON-only worker
  packs a plain dict").
  It declares **no** attachments deliberately, so it never enters the binary-receive loop at all.
  Exported through the lazy PEP 562 surface, so the dependency-free top-level import is unchanged.

### Changed

- **`WorkerTaskProtocol`'s members are now `@abstractmethod` and raise `NotImplementedError`**
  (`APD-SVCCORE-011`). They previously had `pass` bodies, so a partial implementation returned
  `None` into `WorkerCoordinator.get_next_assignment`'s dispatch path. The package's other Protocol
  (`CommandExecutor`) already used the abstract convention; the primer's instruction was to pick one
  per package, and this is that convention applied. Because `Protocol`'s metaclass derives from
  `ABCMeta`, an incomplete implementation now fails at **construction** rather than silently at
  dispatch.
  **Potentially breaking** for a consumer that subclassed `WorkerTaskProtocol` without implementing
  all three members — no such consumer exists in the ecosystem, and no service imports this module.

- **The two shipped defaults refuse subclassing** (`APD-SVCCORE-012`). `LifecycleCommandExecutor`
  and `JsonTaskProtocol` are `@final` **and** raise `TypeError` from `__init_subclass__`. Publishing
  a concrete default beside a Protocol invites the inheritance the composition-only design exists to
  avoid, and neither docstring said whether it was supported — so the answer was whatever the first
  consumer assumed. It is now stated and enforced, and each docstring names the supported variation
  points instead: injection (the `start` callback), implementing the Protocol directly, or wrapping
  an instance.
  `@final` alone would not have held — nothing type-checks this package — so the runtime guard is
  the enforcement and the decorator is documentation for a later checker adoption.
  **Potentially breaking** for a consumer that subclassed either class; verified zero such consumers
  across cascor, data, canopy, recurrence and cascor-worker.

- **An over-limit `/ws/control` frame now closes the connection (1009) instead of continuing**
  (`APD-SVCCORE-005`). The size check necessarily runs after `receive_text()` has materialised the
  frame — that is a transport property, and the real ceiling is uvicorn's `ws_max_size` (16 MiB by
  default) — but the `continue` returned before `_handle_command_message`, the only place a
  rate-limit token is spent, so every oversize frame was free and one connection could repeat the
  allocation indefinitely. Charging the bucket instead would be accounting, not protection: by then
  the allocation has already happened. Closing is also what this loop already does for the adjacent
  protocol violations (malformed JSON, non-object JSON both close 1003), and reconnection is
  governed by the handshake cooldown. 1009 is RFC 6455's "Message Too Big".
  A `pong` frame still costs no token, deliberately and now pinned: the bucket is the *command*
  budget, and charging keepalive would let a command burst rate-limit the client's pong, which the
  heartbeat loop reads as a dead peer and closes 1011.

### Fixed

- **`LeakyBucket`'s docstring no longer misdescribes its own algorithm** (`APD-SVCCORE-013`).
  The class is a **token bucket** — it accumulates up to `capacity` tokens at `refill_rate` per
  second and decrements one per admission, so an idle connection banks a burst and may spend it at
  once. The docstring asserted "leaky-bucket" (a traffic shaper draining at exactly `R`) with no
  correction anywhere, so a reader had nothing to weigh the class name against.
  **The name is deliberately unchanged**: it is exported from `juniper_service_core.websocket`, and
  renaming it would break a published surface to settle an ambiguity the reference material calls
  conventional ("in practice the two are implemented identically and named interchangeably — read
  the code, not the class name"). The docstring now states which algorithm this is, why the name
  stays, and the consequence a caller must not get wrong: **sizing `capacity` as though output were
  smoothed to `refill_rate` will admit `capacity` commands in one instant.** Documentation only: no
  behaviour change, and the burst is now pinned by a test.

- **The `/ws/control` handshake gates are documented as deliberately pre-accept, and the ordering is
  pinned** (`APD-SVCCORE-016`). The four distinct close codes (`1013`, `4029`, `4003`, `4001`) do
  not reach the client — uvicorn converts a pre-accept close into a plain HTTP 403 and discards both
  code and reason. That is **conformant**, not defective: a handshake failure is still HTTP, and
  RFC 6455 §10.2 recommends `403` for an unacceptable Origin. Making the codes observable would
  require accepting the socket *first* and then closing it, completing a handshake for a caller the
  kill switch, the cooldown or the Origin allowlist has already refused — a weaker posture.
  Recorded at `_check_handshake_gates` so the ordering is not "fixed" into that regression, and a
  new test asserts every rejection path leaves the socket un-accepted. Documentation and test only:
  no behaviour change.

- **The worker attachment list is now bounded by count and by total bytes** (`APD-SVCCORE-001`).
  `_handle_task_result` received one binary frame per declared attachment and checked only
  `len(raw_bytes) > _MAX_BINARY_SIZE` per frame, so one submission permitted
  `len(attachment_names) × _MAX_BINARY_SIZE` — a bound on each item is not a bound on the sum, and
  every accepted frame is retained in memory until the submission completes.
  Two independent bounds: `_MAX_ATTACHMENTS = 32` (cardinality, checked **before the first
  `receive()`** so an over-long declaration cannot hold the handler in a receive loop) — ported from
  juniper-cascor's `_MAX_TENSOR_MANIFEST_ENTRIES`, whose own comment names this failure mode — and
  `_MAX_TOTAL_BINARY_SIZE` (aggregate per submission), set equal to the per-frame cap by a stated
  principle rather than an invented magnitude: one submission may not deliver more bytes than a
  single frame was already permitted to carry. The two stay independent policies that merely
  coincide today.

- **The rate limiter's per-process scope is now stated where it is used** (`APD-SVCCORE-007`).
  The constraint itself is deliberate and unchanged — fixed-window counters live in memory, so
  behind multiple replicas each process keeps its own and the effective budget multiplies by the
  replica count. What was missing was disclosure: `RateLimiter` said only "suitable for
  single-process deployments" without the consequence, and `build_rate_limiter` — the function a
  consuming service actually calls — said nothing at all, so a caller choosing
  `requests_per_minute` had no way to learn that four replicas admit four times the configured
  budget. `FailedAuthThrottle`, the sibling control in the same module, already documented this
  properly; the two now agree, and a test pins that they keep agreeing. Documentation only: no
  behaviour change.

- **`Retry-After` no longer tells a rate-limited caller to retry immediately**
  (`APD-SVCCORE-004`). `reset_in` was `int(window - elapsed)`, which truncates toward zero, so any
  sub-second remainder became `0`. A client obeying the header retried at once into a limiter
  guaranteed to reject it again, and kept doing so for the tail of every window. Measured on a
  1-second window before the fix: `Retry-After: 0` at 0.30s, 0.60s, 0.90s and 0.99s in — every
  rejection, not an edge case. Now rounded **up** with a floor of 1: waiting a fraction too long
  costs the caller nothing, waking a fraction early reproduces the defect. Applied to the allowed
  path too, which feeds `X-RateLimit-Reset` — the two headers describe the same instant and were
  free to disagree by a second.

- **`dir(juniper_service_core)` no longer hides the module's own attributes**
  (`APD-SVCCORE-017`). Defining `__dir__` *replaces* the default rather than extending it, so
  returning `sorted(__all__)` made `dir()` a strictly smaller view than the module: `__name__`,
  `__file__`, `__doc__`, `__path__` and every eagerly bound name disappeared. A `__dir__` on a
  PEP 562 module exists to *add* the lazily resolvable names that `globals()` cannot know about,
  not to hide the ones already there. REPL completion and `inspect`-style tooling both read it.

- **WebSocket heartbeat timeouts no longer close with the reserved code 1006.** Both
  `websocket/control_stream.py` and `websocket/training_stream.py` closed a pong-timeout
  connection with `code=1006`. [RFC 6455 §7.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html)
  reserves that value and forbids an endpoint from setting it as a Close-frame status — it
  exists for a *receiver* to report a closure that carried no Close frame at all. The
  `websockets` server used under uvicorn enforces this and raises on serialization, so the
  close frame never reached the peer: the client was left holding a silent half-open socket
  with no code and no reason string. Both sites now close **1011** with reason
  `"Heartbeat timeout: no pong or traffic within <N>s"`, matching the fix `juniper-cascor`
  already applied to its own copies after the 2026-07-10 control-WS incident. The timeout and
  ping interval are also now included in the timeout log line. Guarded by an AST-based
  anti-resurrection test so a new handler cannot reintroduce 1006.

### Security

- **The 401 path is no longer unthrottled.** `SecurityMiddleware` runs authentication before the
  identity-keyed `RateLimiter`, which is correct — a rejected request must not spend a legitimate
  caller's quota, and the limiter's bucket key depends on the auth result (`key:{api_key}`, else
  `ip:{client_ip}`), so limiting first would collapse every authenticated caller behind one NAT
  into a single bucket. But because an auth failure raises before the limiter is ever reached,
  **failed authentication consumed no budget at all**: credential guessing and garbage-credential
  floods were rate limited by nothing.
  The fix is not to reorder — that trades a real protection for a worse one — but to add a second,
  coarse limiter ahead of authentication. See `FailedAuthThrottle` above.

- **The OpenAPI document is no longer served to unauthenticated callers.** `/docs`,
  `/openapi.json` and `/redoc` were in `EXEMPT_PATHS`, and `_is_exempt` is a bare membership test
  evaluated *regardless of whether any API key is configured*. Listing a doc path there therefore
  did not "enable" the document — it **published** it. Because `create_app` also passed no
  `docs_url` / `redoc_url` / `openapi_url`, FastAPI's defaults mounted all three unconditionally,
  so every consumer that used the factory served its complete API surface — every route, schema
  and parameter — to callers with no credentials, even with auth configured and required.
  This is the sibling of `APD-DATA-024` (juniper-data#295) and, unlike the cascor copy, it was
  **live**: `juniper-recurrence` is the sole production consumer of this middleware, it mounts the
  document, and it publishes a host port with `REQUIRE_AUTH` defaulting to true.
  The fix follows the posture already chosen for juniper-data: the three paths are removed from
  `EXEMPT_PATHS` so `SecurityMiddleware` authenticates `/openapi.json` like any other route, and
  `create_app` gains **`explorers_enabled`** (default `True`) to unmount `/docs` and `/redoc` when
  auth is on. The explorers are browser pages that fetch the document by XHR with no `X-API-Key`
  header, so mounting them behind the key would serve a page that can only 401 — while leaving
  them exempt looks like "behind the key" and is in fact "open to everyone". A secured deployment
  stays self-describing to *authenticated* callers instead of silently schema-less.
  **Consumer action required**: pass `explorers_enabled=not settings.api_keys` to `create_app`.
  The default preserves the previous behaviour for deployments that run without auth.
  Pinned by `tests/test_security_middleware_exempt_paths.py`, which asserts the paths' **absence**
  — the regression is additive, so presence-only tests cannot catch it.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **`APIKeyAuth` blank/whitespace-only configured keys no longer enable auth** — aligns with
  `auth_posture.real_keys` so an empty/placeholder secret file cannot leave auth "enabled"
  while accepting an empty `X-API-Key` via `compare_digest("", "")`.
- **Control / worker WebSocket JSON-valid non-object frames fail closed** — arrays / scalars /
  `null` no longer AttributeError on `msg.get` in the control receive loop or worker
  registration handshake; control closes `1003` with `"Invalid control message"`, worker
  registration closes `4008` without registering.
- `WorkerCoordinator.submit_result` now rejects results from a worker that does not own the
  task (`assigned_worker_id is None` or `!= worker_id`) **before** protocol parse — closes the
  cross-worker / unassigned accept footgun that left the assignee busy while a stranger's
  result was collected.
- `WorkerCoordinator.submit_result`: when `parse_result` returns `None`, clear
  `task.assigned_worker_id` and requeue onto `_unassigned_tasks` (in addition to
  `complete_task(..., success=False)`). Pre-fix the worker went idle while the
  task stayed assigned-but-not-queued, so `has_pending_tasks()` went false and a
  later `_check_task_timeouts` sweep could `complete_task` a *newer*
  `active_task_id` on the same worker. `_check_task_timeouts` now only frees the
  worker when `registry.active_task_id` still matches the timed-out task.
- `juniper_service_core/_version.py` `__version__` healed `0.4.0` -> `0.5.0` (the ml#701 stale-dunder class, second live instance — undetected for five days because no gate existed; healed in juniper-ml#702). The 0.5.0 wheel on PyPI carries correct metadata but its `__version__` dunder reports `0.4.0`; this patch release ships the corrected dunder. The release-train now bumps a static package's `_version.py` in lockstep with `pyproject.toml` (juniper-ml#710) and a generic gate guards the class.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **`enforce_auth_posture(...)`** (new `auth_posture` module) — a boot-time auth-posture
  self-check (**SEC-F01**), the security companion to the E-8 `enforce_dependency_floors`
  check. A service calls it at startup, before binding, passing its resolved API keys and
  whether auth is required in this deployment (`require_auth`); it **fails loud** (logs
  `CRITICAL` and raises `AuthPostureError`) when `require_auth=True` but no real key is
  configured, so the server refuses to start rather than silently serving open. This is the
  failure mode confirmed in the containerized-stack security audit (HO-2): every juniper
  HTTP service computes `enabled = len(api_keys) > 0`, so an empty/placeholder secret
  disables `APIKeyAuth` and serves protected routes unauthenticated — with no startup error
  and a `healthy` health check. Three outcomes: a real key → `INFO` (secured); no key +
  `require_auth` False → loud `WARNING` (running OPEN); no key + `require_auth` True →
  `CRITICAL` + raise. A blank/whitespace key (what an empty secret file resolves to) counts
  as unset. Stdlib-only (preserving the dependency-free top-level import); escape hatch
  `JUNIPER_SKIP_AUTH_POSTURE_CHECK` bypasses the check, logged loudly. Exported lazily:
  `enforce_auth_posture`, `auth_is_configured`, `AuthPostureError`. Consuming services adopt
  it at lifespan (mirroring the E-8 `enforce_dependency_floors(distribution=..., logger=...)`
  adoption) and set `require_auth=True` outside an explicit dev/open profile — a follow-up
  per service, gated on the next `juniper-service-core` release.

### Fixed

- **`[test]` extra now includes `prometheus-client>=0.20.0`** — the `workers/metrics`
  tests exercise `WorkerRegistryCollector` (a `prometheus_client` bridge), but the
  dependency was absent from the `test` extra, so those tests silently **skipped** in CI
  and `workers/metrics.py` under-measured. Adding the pin makes CI exercise them. The
  floor mirrors the sibling `juniper-observability` package. Test-only surface — no
  runtime dependency and no version bump.

### Changed

- **Test coverage lifted** for the `workers/`, `lifecycle/`, `routes/`, and top-level
  `juniper_service_core` sub-modules — part of work-unit **C-4** of the per-file coverage
  rollout ([`notes/JUNIPER_2026-06-30_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PER-FILE-COVERAGE-ROLLOUT-SCOPING.md`](../notes/JUNIPER_2026-06-30_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_PER-FILE-COVERAGE-ROLLOUT-SCOPING.md)).
  Each named source file reaches ≥90% statement coverage and each of these sub-modules
  ≥95% statement-weighted pooled coverage, via **real tests only** (no source changes).
  The `websocket/` sub-module is lifted in a parallel sibling PR (C-4a); the blocking
  coverage gate is wired in a follow-up PR once both land.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`enforce_dependency_floors(...)`** (new `dependency_floors` module) — a boot-time
  dependency-floor self-check (**E-8**). A service calls it at startup, before binding, and
  it **fails loud** (raises `DependencyFloorError` naming dep + floor + installed) if any
  installed `juniper-*` wheel is below the service's declared floor — the automatic
  *prevention* companion to the E-2 env-floor-drift *detector*, which would have caught the
  canopy "green tests / dead app" incident at first start with zero human action. Floors
  resolve from an explicit `{dist: min_version}` mapping, the caller's installed Requires-Dist
  metadata (`distribution=`), or a source `pyproject.toml` (`pyproject_path=`). Stdlib-only
  (`importlib.metadata` / `tomllib`; `packaging` optional), so the dependency-free top-level
  import is preserved. An escape hatch (`JUNIPER_SKIP_DEP_FLOOR_CHECK`) bypasses the check —
  logged loudly — so a false positive can never permanently block a legitimate start.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **`create_app(lifespan=...)`** — the app factory now accepts an optional FastAPI
  `lifespan` context manager and forwards it to `FastAPI(lifespan=...)`. A consuming
  service can run startup/shutdown hooks (logging configuration, build-info, resource
  setup/teardown) in a lifespan instead of at import time or in its CLI entrypoint.
  Backward-compatible: omitting `lifespan` is unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-21

The **T2 surface** of the OUT-11 service-tier extraction: the full training-lifecycle orchestrator,
generic HTTP routes, snapshot persistence + replay, the websocket subsystem, and the remote-worker
subsystem — all extracted and de-cascored from `juniper-cascor` with zero cascor coupling. Additive
over 0.1.0; cascor is untouched (its adoption of these bases is WS-6's A-phase). The cascade-bound
parts (correlation reduction, the `Task`/`TaskResult` envelope, cascade frames, dataset-swap history)
stay cascor-side per the OUT-11 design audit (OQ-11).

### Added

#### Training lifecycle (threaded) + generic routes (step 1)

- `ServiceLifecycleManager` — the model-agnostic, **background-threaded** lifecycle body that
  model-core's `TrainingLifecycleBase` deferred to WS-2: drives an injected `TrainableModel` through
  `fit()` on a worker thread, tracks a `LifecycleStateMachine`
  (`STOPPED → STARTED → {PAUSED, COMPLETED, FAILED}`, phase = open `str`), folds `TrainingEvent`s into
  a thread-safe `LifecycleMonitor` (live-state snapshot + bounded metric history), and honors
  cooperative pause/stop at event boundaries.
- **Generic HTTP routes** (`juniper_service_core.routes`) — model-agnostic training-control
  (`/v1/training/{start,stop,pause,resume,reset,status,params}`), metrics (`/v1/metrics`,
  `/v1/metrics/history`), dataset (`/v1/dataset`, `/v1/dataset/data`), and read-only
  model-introspection (`/v1/network`, `/v1/network/topology`) routes over the injected lifecycle
  (`app.state.lifecycle`), plus the shared `ResponseEnvelope` / `success_response` (with numpy-scalar
  coercion). Mount via `create_app(routers=build_routers())`.

#### Snapshot persistence + replay (steps 1b / 1c)

- **Snapshot persistence** — a serializer-injected `SnapshotStore` (one bundle directory per
  snapshot: the model written by an injected `juniper-model-core` `ModelSerializer` + a JSON sidecar
  of lifecycle state) plus the `ServiceLifecycleManager` methods `save_snapshot` / `list_snapshots` /
  `get_snapshot` / `load_snapshot` (→ `INVESTIGATING`) / `restore_for_retrain` (→ `STOPPED`) /
  `resume_from_snapshot` (→ `RESUME_READY`), and the `/v1/snapshots` routes (disk I/O off the event
  loop). Enabled only when a service injects a `ModelSerializer` (otherwise the routes return `501`).
- **Snapshot replay** — `ReplaySession` plays a snapshot's stored metric history back as timed frames
  on a background daemon (play / pause / seek / speed / range / stop / status; an injectable
  `on_frame` sink), plus `start_replay` (→ `REPLAYING`) / `replay_control` / `stop_replay` /
  `get_replay_state` and the `POST /v1/snapshots/{id}/replay[/control]` routes.

#### WebSocket subsystem (step 2)

- `juniper_service_core.websocket` — the model-agnostic websocket surface: `WebSocketManager`
  (monotonic sequencing, bounded replay buffer, oversized-message chunking, thread-safe broadcast,
  per-endpoint connection accounting) + the generic message builders (the 7 model-agnostic frames) +
  control-path security (`validate_control_origin` / `LeakyBucket` / `HandshakeCooldown`) + the
  `/ws/training` (metrics stream) and `/ws/control` (command channel) handlers + `build_websocket_router`.
- **Injectable `CommandExecutor`** (default `LifecycleCommandExecutor`) — the control-channel dispatch
  adapter, so a service maps the wire commands onto its own orchestration.
- `attach_websocket` lifecycle→broadcast bridge — live-training **and** replay frames push to
  `/ws/training` clients via the manager's additive `frame_sink`.

#### Worker subsystem (step 3)

- **Worker-pool foundations** (`juniper_service_core.workers`) — `WorkerRegistry` /
  `WorkerRegistration` / `WorkerRegistryFullError` + security primitives (`TLSConfig` mTLS,
  `ConnectionRateLimiter` token-bucket, `AnomalyDetector` over a generic bounded quality `score`) +
  audit (`AuditLogger` / `WorkerMetrics` / `AuditEventType`) + `WorkerRegistryCollector` (a
  `prometheus_client` bridge; configurable `metric_prefix`, pending-tasks via an injected callable).
- **`WorkerCoordinator`** — generic task dispatch / collect / timeout / retry with a worker-liveness
  early-exit and a background health monitor, over an injectable `WorkerTaskProtocol` seam
  (`build_assignment` + `parse_result` + `result_attachments`; the `CommandExecutor` analogue). Result
  reduction stays consumer-side (`collect_results` returns the raw list).
- **`/ws/workers` stream** (`worker_stream_handler`) — the machine-to-machine worker channel
  (origin-reject, `X-API-Key` auth, per-source rate-limit, registration handshake with a
  server-assigned id, heartbeat + enriched-field forwarding, dispatch + binary-frame transport), plus
  `attach_worker_pool` app-wiring and `build_worker_router`.

### Changed

- `lifecycle` is now a subpackage (`lifecycle/{sync,manager,monitor,state_machine,snapshots,replay}.py`);
  the synchronous `TrainingLifecycle` / `EventCollector` moved to `lifecycle/sync.py` and are
  re-exported, so `from juniper_service_core.lifecycle import TrainingLifecycle` is unchanged.
- All new lifecycle / route / websocket / worker public names are exported **lazily** via the PEP 562
  `__getattr__` (and listed in the `TYPE_CHECKING` block for CodeQL), so the dependency-free top-level
  import (`import juniper_service_core`) still holds (`fastapi` loads only when a subsystem is accessed).

### Notes

- **Adds a `numpy>=1.24` runtime dependency** (the generic routes marshal inline request arrays at the
  model boundary). It loads lazily with `.routes`, so the dependency-free top-level import is preserved.
- **Cascade-bound parts stay cascor-side** per OQ-11: correlation-based result reduction, the
  `Task`/`TaskResult` envelope, the `cascade_add` / `candidate_progress` frames, topology /
  per-sample-weight replay, and dataset-swap history. cascor adopts the generic bases in WS-6.
- Every generic surface is proven by a both-stacks-green contract test driven by model-core's
  **regression** reference models (the RK-6 guard against classification/cascade assumptions).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Initial package scaffold for the shared service-tier library (WS-2 of the
  model/middleware refactor).
- `SettingsBase` — `pydantic-settings` base with generic `service_name` / `host` /
  `port` / `log_level` fields; subclasses set their own `env_prefix`.
- `create_app(...)` — model-agnostic FastAPI application factory that mounts the
  generic health router and any service-supplied routers.
- Generic health router (`health_router()`) exposing `GET /v1/health` (liveness) and
  `GET /v1/health/ready` (readiness), plus a `HealthStatus` model.
- Dependency-free top-level import: `import juniper_service_core` exposes only
  `__version__` eagerly; `create_app` / `SettingsBase` load lazily via PEP 562
  `__getattr__`.
- Generic service-infra extraction from `juniper-cascor` (de-cascored, zero cascor
  coupling): `security` (`APIKeyAuth`, `RateLimiter`, `api_key_header`, plus the
  config-injected `build_api_key_auth` / `build_rate_limiter` factories replacing
  cascor's global-settings singletons), `secrets` (`get_secret` Docker file-secret
  reader), and `middleware` (`SecurityHeadersMiddleware`, `RequestBodyLimitMiddleware`,
  `SecurityMiddleware`, `EXEMPT_PATHS`) — with cascor's `cascor_constants` body-size /
  status-code imports replaced by local module constants. All exported lazily via the
  PEP 562 `__getattr__` so the dependency-free top-level import still holds.
- `launcher` — generic subprocess-managed companion-service runner extracted from
  `juniper-cascor` (de-cascored, zero cascor coupling): `ManagedService` (subprocess
  wrapper with `is_running` / `terminate`), `wait_for_health` (poll an HTTP health
  endpoint), `start_service` (`Popen` a service and wait for health), plus the
  `atexit`-registered cleanup of the module-level active-services registry. Cascor's
  `cascor_constants` timeout/interval imports are replaced by local module constants,
  and the log-dir resolution is generic (`JUNIPER_SERVICE_LOG_DIR`, else `./logs`).
  Exported lazily via the PEP 562 `__getattr__` (stdlib-only, so the dependency-free
  top-level import still holds).
- `lifecycle` — the **synchronous** `TrainingLifecycleBase` body: `TrainingLifecycle`
  drives a `juniper-model-core` `TrainableModel`'s `fit()` to completion and forwards its
  `TrainingEvent`s to the injected sink, stamping a monotonic run-scoped `seq` so the
  lifecycle owns event ordering; plus an `EventCollector` ordered sink. Growable models
  grow inside `fit()` (model-core contract), so this one body drives both fixed-topology
  and growable models. The threaded / FSM / worker-coordinated bodies (OQ-11) are
  deferred. Exported lazily so the dependency-free top-level import still holds.
- Publish (`publish-service-core.yml`) and CI (`ci-service-core.yml`) workflows.

### Notes

- Additive only. Extracts cascor's generic service infra (security / secrets / middleware /
  launcher); the websocket / worker / generic-route helpers are not extracted yet.
- The `lifecycle` body adds a dependency on **`juniper-model-core`** (the model contract).
  **Publish-first:** `juniper-model-core` must be on PyPI before `juniper-service-core` is
  published; in the monorepo, CI installs it editable from the sibling subdir first. The
  dependency-free top-level import is preserved (the lifecycle module is imported lazily).
- Published to PyPI 2026-06-16 (tag `juniper-service-core-v0.1.0`).
