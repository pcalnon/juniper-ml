# Juniper: Dynamic Neural Network Research Platform

Juniper is an AI/ML research platform for investigating dynamic neural network architectures and novel learning paradigms.  The project emphasizes ground-up implementations from primary literature, enabling a more transparent exploration of fundamental algorithms.

## Juniper ML

`juniper-ml` is the **public face of the Juniper platform on PyPI**. It is the meta-distribution that aggregates the platform's client libraries — `juniper-data-client`, `juniper-cascor-client`, `juniper-cascor-worker`, and `juniper-doc-tools` — behind a single installation entry point. The package additionally serves as the version-anchor for cross-component compatibility, the home of the platform-level documentation index, and the host repository from which two independently-tagged sibling packages (`juniper-observability` and `juniper-doc-tools`) are published. External callers who want to interact with Juniper services from their own Python code should start here.

## Distribution

`juniper-ml` is published on PyPI as **[`juniper-ml`](https://pypi.org/project/juniper-ml/)**. It provides a single installation entry point for the platform's client stack:

```bash
pip install juniper-ml[all]
```

Individual components — `juniper-data-client`, `juniper-cascor-client`, `juniper-cascor-worker`, `juniper-doc-tools`, and `juniper-observability` — remain installable in isolation for callers that require finer control over their dependency surface.

## Ecosystem Compatibility

This meta-package is part of the [Juniper](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-ml) ecosystem.
Verified compatible versions:

| juniper-data | juniper-cascor | juniper-canopy | data-client | cascor-client | cascor-worker |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0.6.x        | 0.4.x          | 0.4.x          | >=0.4.1     | >=0.4.0       | >=0.3.0       |

For full-stack Docker deployment and integration tests, see [`juniper-deploy`](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-deploy).

## Architecture

`juniper-ml` is a meta-package: it ships no importable code of its own. Its role is to declare, version, and install the libraries through which external callers interact with the platform's services. The diagram below reproduces the platform's dependency graph from the parent ecosystem documentation; `juniper-ml` sits at the bottom-right, aggregating the client side.

## Active Research Components

The active research components of the Juniper platform are surfaced through the component repositories listed below. Each repository's README documents the algorithms, datasets, protocols, or operational primitives it implements; `juniper-ml` aggregates their client surfaces and does not host research code of its own.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.12

The meta-package itself has no other prerequisites. Component-specific requirements (e.g. a running `juniper-data` or `juniper-cascor` service) are documented in the corresponding component repository.

### Installation

```bash
pip install juniper-ml[all]            # full client stack
pip install juniper-ml[clients]        # client libraries only
pip install juniper-ml[worker]         # distributed worker only
pip install juniper-ml[doc-tools]      # markdown link validator only
```

### Verification

Confirm the client libraries are importable:

```python
from juniper_data_client import JuniperDataClient
from juniper_cascor_client import JuniperCascorClient
```

Confirm the documentation tooling CLI is on `PATH`:

```bash
juniper-check-doc-links --version
```

## Research Philosophy

The Juniper platform exists to study learning algorithms whose network architecture is not fixed in advance. Its initial anchor is the Cascade-Correlation algorithm of Fahlman and Lebiere (1990), implemented from the primary literature without recourse to higher-level abstractions that elide the algorithm's operational detail. The organising commitment is that algorithm implementations remain inspectable at the level at which they were originally specified: candidate units, correlation objectives, weight-freezing semantics, and the structural events that grow the network are first-class artifacts of the codebase rather than internal details of a library wrapper. This permits comparative work — across algorithms, datasets, and hyperparameter regimes — to be conducted on a known and reproducible substrate.

The current platform comprises a Cascade-Correlation training service exposing a REST and WebSocket interface, a dataset-generation service with a named-version registry that includes the ARC-AGI families, a real-time monitoring dashboard for inspecting training dynamics as they occur, and a distributed worker that parallelises candidate-unit training across hosts. Near-term work extends the architectural-growth catalogue beyond Cascade-Correlation, introduces multi-network orchestration for comparative experiments at the level of network populations rather than individual runs, and tightens the dataset–training–monitoring loop into a reproducible research workbench. The longer-term direction is the systematic empirical study of constructive and architecture-growing learning algorithms, with first-class infrastructure for the ablation, comparison, and replication that such a study requires.

Within this programme, `juniper-ml` is the integration surface: a single installation entry point that aggregates the client libraries needed to interact with the platform from external Python code, and a version-anchor that makes the compatibility of components legible at a glance.
